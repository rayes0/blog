#  LocalWords:  Honobu Yonezawa Oreki Houtarou Houtarou's Chp Kyoani Chitanda
#  LocalWords:  Hyouka Houtarou's Chitanda's Takemoto

Meta-collection of loosely chronologically ordered miscellaneous thoughts on the /Classic Literature Club/ light novel series by Honobu Yonezawa, compiled slowly bit by bit over many weeks as I reread all 6 volumes and rewatch all 22 episodes. The series showcases Oreki Houtarou, a high school boy and zealous energy conservationist. Starting with his first day of high school, it follows him as he experiences new situations challenging his previous way of life. An 'energy frugality' personality seems fairly common among individuals today, especially teens around Houtarou's age. Perhaps one of the reasons this series resonated with me so much is because I used to be that way myself (and maybe still am?). The sections in this article are not directly connected to each other, and most headings mark individual sections with individual thoughts, so if you are encouraged not to read the entire long-winded article, and just skip to sections you are interested in. I do suggest, however, that you read all six novels, and preferably also finish all the anime episodes before you read. All my haranguing will make much more sense if you do.

*** Synopsis
For those not in the loop, the basic premise of the series goes something like this: A boy by the name Oreki Houtarou is impelled to join the Classics Club of his high school by his sister, currently travelling in India. As all previous members had graduated, the club was in danger of being abolished, something his sister, a previously avid member, couldn't bear.

However, Houtarou isn't just a teen that would jovially comply with anything he is told to do. It turns out Houtarou adheres to a stringent doctrine: "If I don't have to do it, I won't. If I have to do it, make it quick". And he isn't exactly happy about his life getting derailed through a letter from India.

But being the good little brother he is, he eventually complies (with a little bit of fear to motivate him[fn:: Tomoe Oreki (Hotarou's sister) is said to be specialized in a form of martial arts called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiho_Jutsu][Taiho-jutsu]], said by Hotarou to be "pretty painful if one has intent to hurt"]) and thus meets the venerable Chitanda Eru, a member seeking to join for "personal reasons". Fukabe and Mayaka, two of Houtarou's friends, also eventually join the club. Together, as the four of them go about their club activities (which almost entirely consists of Chitanda pulling them into solving mysteries), Houtarou's previous conservational lifestyle is repeatedly challenged. As the story progresses through each new arc, each time he solves a mystery, each time he does something contradicting his motto, and his evolving relationship with Chitanda, Houtarou starts considering and even longing for what he coins a "rose-coloured life". However, like many aspects of our world, things aren't so black and white. There are positives and negatives to this, leaving Houtarou in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bind][a mess of decision fatigue]] for most of the series, but he can't deny that he is changing. For the better or the worse.

*** Initially: If I don't have to, I won't
#+begin_quote
  Truth is the daughter of time.

  (Old proverb. Quoted in Josephine Tey's *The Daughter of Time[fn:daughter-of-time]*)
#+end_quote


Houtarou's indolent motto: "If I don't have to do it, I won't. If I have to do it, make it quick". While this could be interpreted as Houtarou being motivated to follow through with his identity, I personally think that Houtarou is just lazy and uses this motto as an excuse not to do anything.

We are not told much background about Houtarou (at least in the span of the anime, the later novels go into more detail). We know he has an older sister who travels a lot, and as a consequence he is alone at home most of the time. He isn't very social and doesn't do things like hang out with friends. In fact it is shown that his two closest friends (Mayaka whom he has known since first grade and Satoshi from middle school) haven't ever stepped foot into his house.

Laziness is defined by a lack of motivation. In Houtarou's case, he is unmotivated to participate in club activities and other hallmarks of a rosy-coloured life. Right off the bat, I can think of a couple of causes from the three big schools of thought in psychology:

*Psychoanalytic  - /The pleasure principle/*: The Freudian idea that we will put off doing activities that cause negative emotions like stress and anxiety in an attempt to avoid these emotions. However, I don't think that Frued's psychosexual stages is responsible for Houtarou's behaviour. First of all, there is little actual scientific support for the theory[fn:4], but more importantly it appears that Houtarou is purposefully adhering to his motto (more on this later), and fully aware that he is doing so. This is something out of scope for Freud's theories, which involve the patient's unconscious thoughts. I am not completely dismissing the possibility though. Houtarou could have an unconscious trigger for thinking this way that influences his conscious decisions (a generic example would be some types of cognitive biases, where our mind is unconsciously irrational which leads to consciously making irrational decisions).

*Neuroscientific theory - /Lack of dopamine/*: Dopamine is given off when a reward is /anticipated/ (independently of whether a reward is actually received or not[fn:5][fn:6]), and low dopamine is highly correlated with low motivation (remember, correlation is not causation though[fn:7]). Moreover, dopamine is one of the major factors our brains use to decide whether something is /worth the effort or not/[fn:6]. Houtarou deems that a large majority of seemingly normal high school activities are not worth the effort, including things like joining a club, or going for a run outside (these two are direct examples from the anime). The cause of this could be that he doesn't anticipate reward from these activities.

*Behaviourist theory - /Incentive motivation/*: Behavioural psychology is based around the idea that the individuals are a direct product of their environment, and thus we should be considered about the observable characteristics of individuals[fn:9]. Motivation is highly associated with the conditioning process[fn:10], specifically the ideas of reinforcement and punishment. He may not see any tangible short term or long term incentives for wasting his energy (this is related to the dopamine theory talked about above). From this, we can gain that the behaviour of Houtarou could come from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement#Operant_conditioning][reinforcement]] of his energy conserving lifestyle (either through adding a desirable stimulus, or taking away an undesirable one). Additionally in operant conditioning, if a behaviour can be trained through reinforcement, it can also be 'untrained' through [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punishment_(psychology)][punishment]], which we can interpret to be Chitanda.

**** The Curse of Knowledge
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: the-curse-of-knowledge
   :END:

#+begin_quote
I know that I know nothing.

(The Socratic paradox)
#+end_quote

It's actually quite common among skilled individuals to underestimate themselves. The converse is also true, incompetent individuals tend to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect][overestimate their ability]]. The typically accepted explanation for this is that competent individuals are subject to the infamous bias known as the 'curse of knowledge'. As an individual improves at a task, their perceived standards go up, and they assume that other individuals will be competent enough to understand them. Incompetent individuals often do not have the necessary skills to recognize their own errors, and thus often believe they are performing better than they are in reality. You can imagine that his has practical application in education, where the teacher may not sympathize with why students don't understand concepts.

This could be something that Houtarou is experiencing. Conceiving ideas from the perspective of others is actually excruciatingly difficult, and whether we like it or not, it influences our decisions to some level. This egocentrism is something everyone faces to some degree, because accepting someone else's view oftentimes means neglecting our own.

Therefore, it could be that Houtarou, adept at solving mysteries, is simply too indifferent as to why the people around him cannot do the same things he is doing. He considers himself ordinary, and thinks that if he can do it, everyone else should be more than capable to match him, especially Chitanda, with an astounding memory, top scores at Kamiyama high school, and part of a wealthy family. Chitanda thinks the exact same about her grades, and that anyone is capable of doing what she is doing given that they have all the pieces, but that she wants to look at the "big picture" (more on this later). Note that the curse of knowledge is largely unconscious, meaning Houtarou himself may not be aware that he is thinking this way.

In many ways, egocentrism and the curse of knowledge are forms of pride, though not in the traditional sense where one has exceedingly high regard of oneself. As stated above, accepting other's views means neglecting effort and energy focusing on our own, and potentially requires amendment on our part or in some cases finding out that you are flat out wrong. Pride is referred to in the series when the characters talk about it as one of the seven deadly things. Chitanda notes that the sins are not necessarily bad, and having a balance of them is important. For example, she thinks that if you have no pride, then it follows that you would have no self-confidence either. Personally, though he feels he is, I do not think that Houtarou is victim to pride. He clearly shows he is capable of looking at things from another's perspective, not only to solve mysteries through reasoning through the culprit's motives, but in his everyday life with the other club members as well (such as through the Valentine chocolate mystery).

**** Zugzwang for Oreki
   :PROPERTIES:

   :END:
{{< figure src="/img/hyouka/oreki.png" >}}

When I was reading the newspaper club mystery arc (episode 3 of the anime), I thought it was interesting how Houtarou falls to blackmail-like tactics in order to find the location of the anthologies through threatening to publicize the smoking habits of the club president. Interestingly enough, Houtarou is a victim of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_blackmail][another kind of blackmail]] by none other than Chitanda. Although this is seen throughout the entire series, it is especially apparent in Chitanda asking the favour of finding out about her uncle.

One could argue that asking any kind of favour from another person could technically be considered emotional blackmail, and they wouldn't be wrong. When asking someone to help us with something, to some degree, we always have expectations of them[fn:12], but there is definitely a difference between friends expecting to cater to each others needs and a blackmailer purposefully acting in a controlling way to make the victim complete tasks that are undesirable and uncomfortable doing.

Note that Chitanda may or may not be doing this on purpose, and is certainly not doing it for malicious purposes, I just thought it was interesting how Houtarou falls for it.

It is around the end of Chapter 6 of Volume 1, or in episode 5 of the anime (the Sekitani Jun mystery) that Houtarou starts to actively, perhaps consciously question his conversational lifestyle. Here is a meta-list of the factors that affect Houtarou's decisions throughout the series. Positive factor being contributory ones, and negative factors being factors that result in him resisting a rosy life. The mix of positives and negatives, with compelling arguments from both sides, lead to a large amount of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bind][emotional distress]] for Houtarou.

**** To Commit a Misunderstanding
#+begin_quote
  But what was it that made me angry? I find myself difficult to understand sometimes.

  (Chitanda. Vol. 4, Story 2/Ep 6)
#+end_quote

In volume 4, story 2 of the novel, or episode 6 of the anime (both are titled 'To Commit A Deadly Sin'), Chitanda yells at the math teacher Omichi-sensei, who had mistaken the progress the class had made on the textbook and asked a question on a topic that hadn't been covered yet. What's interesting is that Chitanda is unsure the precise reason she was angry. She denies a couple proposed possibilities:

1. Because the students did not know the answer to the question, Omichi wrongfully criticized them for "attitude towards lessons" and "love of learning", all while keeping a violent air by slapping the blackboard with a bamboo pole. Chitanda says that she wouldn't get angry over this because she believed that if students were slacking off, Omichi had every right to punish them.
2. There were people in the class who knew the answer (presumably because they had studied ahead) but kept quiet out of fear of the angry teacher. Chitanda denies this as no one would want to answer in the given situation anyways. Also if someone had answered, the lesson would have continued while it was already too far ahead.
3. No one pointed out the teacher's mistake. Chitanda denies this, probably due to sympathy. Talking back to an angry teacher slamming a blackboard with a pole is scary.
4. Tamura, the person who Omichi singled out to answer the question, looked pitiful. Chitanda also denies this, saying that although she did pity him, and she wouldn't get angry over just that.

Regardless, thanks again to Houtarou's deductive skill, Chitanda learns that the situation is simply a misunderstanding, and that Omichi probably mistaked the lowercase letter "d" for "a" because of sloppy handwriting.

In this story/episode, the group is quick to associate Mayaka with the sin of wrath, and Houtarou with the sin of sloth. In reality though, the message of this episode has to do with possibly the deadliest sin of all, from which all the other sins stem: pride. The mistake Chitanda made (leading to her wrongfully getting angry) was assuming that Omichi was intentionally trying to bully his students. In other words, out of pride, she thought she had the knowledge that she knew what Omichi was thinking, and she assumed that because of this, she was justified in standing up and yelling at him.

Whats really interesting though, is Houtarou. Here's the relevant snippet from the novel and an incredibly well represented scene from the anime showing his thoughts:

#+attr_shortcode: "Hyouka (Houtarou) Vol.4, Story 2"
#+begin_pquote
This is what I thought deep down.

The normally calm Chitanda got angry, and she wanted to know why. She said that it's not necessarily bad to get angry, but the truth is that she never wants to. Perhaps Chitanda wanted Omichi to have had his reasons, and wanted to believe that she got angry because of her own mistake, so she wanted to understand her reasons for getting angry.

Isn't Chitanda that kind of person?

No.

I shook my head to chase that last thought away.

[...]

That's right. I've managed to predict her actions sometimes, but then again, her motives were clearly shown, and to think that I can read her innermost thoughts would be, as she said, to commit a deadly sin. The deadly sin of pride. I'd better watch out, I've somehow become quite conceited. Even just today, how many times has Chitanda acted different from my expectations? "Hyouka (Houtarou) Vol.4, Story 2"
#+end_pquote

#+html: {{< figure src="/img/hyouka/pride.png" >}}

Now how does this tie into the context of their relationship? I have two possibilities:

- The unlikely (but somewhat intriguing) possibility: Houtarou is self-conscious about the fact that he tricked her about the Silk Spider Society previously, and is worried that she has potentially found out. He tries to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalization_(psychology)][rationalize]] the situation by telling Chitanda through a roundabout way that he had his reasons for doing it. Seeing this, he believed that this really was the case, whether due to confirmation bias or because he actually saw it in Chitanda's face. This is wildly unlikely, and I just included it for speculation sake (this whole article is mainly just speculations anyways).
- The likely (and very intriguing) possibility: Houtarou is cautious that he is thinking of Chitanda differently than he was at the beginning of the series, perhaps maybe even starting to be romantically attracted. Due to the previous situation with the Sekitani Jun mystery, Houtarou is seriously weighing the drawbacks of a rosy colored life, and is not mentally ready for deciding to pursue one, so mentally rejects Chitanda. This is made fairly apparent when we compare it to the incidents of Houtarou's thoughts about his other two friends. When Mayaka asked Chitanda why she was angry, Houtarou is able to immediately guess why she asked her question. The same goes for likening Satoshi to a grasshopper, which he has no problems doing. Chitanda is the only individual he treats differently. His dilemma could be summed up in the following quote:

#+attr_shortcode: "Hyouka (Houtarou) Vol.4, Story 2"
#+begin_pquote
I would largely understand Satoshi's thoughts and feelings, since I've known him since middle school. The same can be said of Ibara, who has been in the same class as me for nine years and can be said to be an acquaintance. But what do I know about Chitanda?
#+end_pquote

**** Withered Flowers, When examined - Ego depletion
Episode 7 of the anime (or Vol 4, Story 3 - The Ghost, When examined), on the outside seems merely just a trip to the hot springs and a small mystery about a ghost that was actually just the shadow of a yukata, but as typical with KyoAni anime, things go deeper than the surface.

Houtarou's physical fatigue is indicative of his mental condition. He is in a state of decision fatigue similar to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis][analysis paralysis]], where the benefits and drawbacks to a rosy colored life, and more directly his relationship with Chitanda, are still very cloudy to him. I am amazed how well this is shown in the context of the four characters on the bus ride scene, with Houtarou making the following metaphysical digression:

#+attr_shortcode: "(Houtarou) Vol.4, Story 3, Chp 1"
#+begin_pquote
I've often heard the saying, "All ghosts, when examined, are just withered flowers." However, in this modern era, people are unable to grasp the idea of romanticism even after looking it up in a dictionary, withered flowers are rarely treated as ghosts, and apparitions in this world are revealed in succession to be nothing more than withered flowers. It would probably be difficult for us to notice a real specter if it kept its true form.
#+end_pquote

I am fairly certain that the choice of withered flowers for the comparison here is not an accident. We are talking about a rosy coloured life after all, and two consecutive shots in the anime OP makes it pretty clear. Notice the similarities between the head positions of the characters and the flower positions.

#+html: {{< figure src="/img/hyouka/flowers.png" >}}
#+html: {{< figure src="/img/hyouka/flowers2.png" >}}

The three flowers represent the three friends, so we can interpret what Houtarou is saying not as literally talking about ghosts and withered flowers, but of love and a rosy-coloured life. Houtarou is apparently still convinced that a rosy coloured life only looks good on the outside, in reality the rose is withered. The previous Sekitani Jun mystery likely played a role in him thinking this way.

Given this context, his side remark about romance is quite ironic: "people are unable to grasp the idea of romanticisim even after looking it up in a dictionary". At this stage, I would say the Chitanda and Houtarou are already close enough that they both should be able to realize they have a thing for each other. Similarly, Mayaka has openly admitted to liking Satoshi since middle school but Satoshi has never returned an answer and has been avoiding the issue. The group of four may be the very ones who can't grasp romanticism. Chitanda's later nonchalant mention of mixed baths adds to this further. Or this might just be one of Chitanda's oddities. It's getting harder to tell the difference.

Another key feature of this arc is the relationship between siblings, fueled by the relationship between Kaho and Rie. Chitanda and Houtarou's perspectives differ in this area. Chitanda believes that having a sibling is nice, whereas Houtarou believes it to be a burden, drawing from his relationship with his own sister, which he views as negative. In a way, this is indicative of the antipodal personalities of the two, Chitanda being curious and outbounding whereas Houtarou being an energy conversationalist, just like how Houtarou doesn't believe in ghosts and thinks a rosy coloured life is just a wilted flower, whereas Chitanda thinks precisely the opposite (and she also believes in ghosts).

At first, we may be quick to dismiss Chitanda's opinion in favour of Houtarou's because of the apparent negative air between Kaho and Rie due to Kaho's possessive nature, and the fact that Houtarou's opinion should be more trustworthy because he has a sister himself. However, there are a couple reasons why Houtarou's argument isn't necessarily foolproof either. Firstly, though he has a sister, he doesn't actually spend a lot of time with her. She is out travelling a lot, and even if she is home, Houtarou prefers spending time alone anyways. Her sister also always pushes him to do more and more things he dislikes, such as using violence[fn:violence] to push him to join a club for selfish reasons, which would contribute to his negativity. Houtarou makes the mistake of assuming that just because his sister is like that, all sibling-sibling relationships should be, a generalization fallacy. Two obvious factors he doesn't consider are the gender and age gap differences. Tomoe is a female and Houtarou is male, whereas the Kaho and Rie are both female. I speculate based on first hand experience (I have two siblings of opposite gender) and observing relationships between siblings in other families that siblings of the same gender identify with each other more, and are thus more likely to create a tighter relationship. The age gap between Tomoe and Houtarou is also larger than those of Kaho and Rie. The larger the age gap, the more distant the relationship is likely to be (again based on my own speculations). It is therefore expected that Tomoe and Houtarou will have a more distant relationship than the Zenna sisters. Despite having a sibling himself, Houtarou is not justified in assuming its the same for others.

I think this is why I find the ending of this arc to be one of the most satisfying moments in the entire series. As Chitanda and Houtarou, walking back from the hot spring, approach two figures in the distance, they turn out to be Kaho who is cheerfully giving Rie a piggyback. Chitanda's sorrow turns into joy as she runs towards them, and Houtarou silently admits he was wrong. That sibling relationships may not be withered flowers after all. Indirectly, what he is saying is that a rose coloured life may not be as bad as he thought it to be. In other words, Houtarou was wrong.

**** The Blind Spot of Houtarou
#+begin_quote
  Young men are sadly degenerate nowadays.

  (Why Didn't They Ask Evans?[fn:18] by Agatha Christie)
#+end_quote

This leads us to the movie arc, spanning volume 2 of the novel series and episodes 8-11 of the anime (The order is slightly different in the novels and anime, the previous ghost yukata mystery arc was broadcasted right after the Sekitani Jun mystery, whereas in the novels it happens in volume 4). Going back to our discussion about the [[#the-curse-of-knowledge][curse of knowledge]], Houtarou at this stage, is overestimating his abilities, especially in judging at a topic he is not well versed in (a rosy-colored life, for instance), which is what I think, leads to him being manipulated by Irisu.

If we think more about the reason that Houtarou was tricked, we can see that there is one consistent thing that Houtarou is willing to spend energy for. Despite his attitude, Houtarou is actually kind and cares more about his friends than he seems to. We see this in the way he accepts his sister's letter to join the club for her sake, or how goes through much effort in finding the truth behind Chitanda's uncle because he sees how hard Chitanda is working. Later, we see it in how he gives flour to help the club's chance at winning the cooking contest, and how he reprimands Satoshi for Mayaka's sake (the Valentines Day incident). These are all done out of his own volition, there may have been pressure involved from his friends, but ultimately, Houtarou is still the one who decides to put in the energy. You could call it the power of friendship.

Irisu exploits this weakness in her pushing him to come up with a satisfying script. In particular, he is won over by the story Irisu tells him about two athletes, on of them the ace of the team whereas the other one was a bench player. The bench player worked hard every day to catch up to the ace player, but then hears the ace say in an interview that she is where she is purely due to luck, which is very demotivating to hear for the bench player. Interestingly enough, this is the exact situation between Houtarou and Satoshi, though Houtarou is unaware of this now, or at least seems to be. Part of the reason Irisu's story works so well in convincing Houtarou is that she exploits the emotional aspect of causing his friends stress.

However though, because Satoshi is actually jealous of Houtarou's talent, Houtarou's name for the movie: "The Blind Spot of 10,000", is ironic in that Houtarou himself is oblivious to a couple things, each one leading to the next, from the local conflict of this arc to the grand theme of the story:

- Irisu's pretense Irisu really just wanted to use Houtarou to finish the script, and all the talk about talent was just to get him on her side. When eventually confronted by Houtarou after he figures this out, she tells him: "It was not spoken from the bottom of my heart. But it is up to you to decide whether that counts as a lie". Houtarou wanted to think that he was right, which ties back into the deadly sin of pride. If we take pride as being a pointer to a rosy coloured life, we see that Houtarou is starting to embrace it.
- Satoshi's jealousy. For much of the story up until this point, we haven't had much insight into Satoshi. We are told that he is a database of useless information, and is described by Houtarou as being dyed a "shocking pink" colour. Consider the meaning of his words in the context of this arc. He has studied hard to become versed in mystery, and is passionate to become a 'Holmesian', in other words, he longs for what Houtarou has proved to be good at in the past 5 volumes. Think of the admiration he must have felt each time Houtarou solves a tough mystery, and think of what he must have been thinking when Houtarou carelessly attributes it to luck. In Irisu's story about the athletes, Satoshi mirrors the role of the benched athlete, and Houtarou is the star player.
- His relationship with Chitanda. This is probably the cause of him unsure of what he thinks, especially in the light of the recent events where he has been ordered around by the women in his life. which have produced drastic stress and inconveniences for him, namely Chitanda, Tomoe and Irisu, as well as once during his middle school days (revealed from a later unadapted novel)

Why was Houtarou so mad at Irisu then? After all it didn't really matter what she thought of him, or even that she tricked him. In fact, the entire movie is none of his business in the first place. I think Houtarou is angry simply because of his expectations. Irisu created the illusion of responsibility for Houtarou. He genuinely believed that he was expected to finish the movie, similarly to the Sekitani Jun arc where he believed he had to meet Chitanda's expectations. Irisu cites that she heard of Houtarou from three individuals: Chitanda, someone outside the school (presumably Houtarou's sister Tomoe[fn:19]), and Toogaito Shouji, the Wall Newspaper Club president (whom Houtarou blackmailed in one of the earlier points of the story). That's a fairly high bar of expectations to clear, and when Houtarou realizes that a) Irisu didn't actually mean what she said about his talent, b) All Irisu wanted was results, Houtarou just happened to be the easiest path to those, c) He wasted energy for no benefit to himself, and d) He had been played because of his willingness to help out, it is understandable he would get angry. In fact, incidents like these are the root of his motto and why he follows it, which we are told about in a story from a later novel not adapted into the anime.

Did Irisu have ill intentions then? I don't believe so. At least according to the anime she didn't. In a later episode (specifically episode 22, the last one), she clears up the matter after the doll festival:

Note that there is no comparable line in the novels, so this is likely something which Takemoto the director has added that perhaps was not intended to be elicited by the Yonezawa.

*** Finally: After a long detour
#+begin_quote
Isn't this a small world? All I did was resolve an issue between two villages in the northern region of Kamiyama City, or to use its colloquial name, Jinde. Oreki-san, I do not think that it is an insignificant act, but I cannot think of it as something major.

(Chitanda [on the issue of an alternate route for the doll procession]) Vol. 4, Story 7,  Chp 5
#+end_quote
**** What Chitanda meant by "big picture"
As the ending of the anime is not the end of the story (it was just the most reasonable place to stop given the novel material available at the time), it is quite a cliffhanger and as a result quite disappointing, even for me who had read the novels and knew the story way past that point. I, like many others, would love to see the story adapted past this point. Unfortunately, there is not enough source material as of now, and to top it off most of the Hyouka crew at Kyoani sadly died in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Animation_arson_attack][arson attack]] in 2019.

Of course, the ending is still meaningful in it's own right, even without considering further novels if viewed as a coming of age story where the characters mature over time. Some may even say it's the best, or the only reasonable ending given the personalities of the characters over time.

First of all the hidden implications of romance are obvious. From Chitanda:

#+begin_pquote
"Please take a look, Oreki-san. This is my place. All that's here is water and soil. The people are growing old and tired. The mountains are regularly afforested, but what do you think of its value? I do not think that this place is the most beautiful. Nor is it full of potential. But then..."

She put down her arms and looked down.

"I wanted you to see it, Oreki-san."
#+end_pquote

From Oreki:

#+begin_pquote
At that time, I gained an answer to a doubt I had been holding.

I wanted to say thisː "By the way, about the business strategy that you gave up on, how about I take care of that for you?"
#+end_pquote

This is in fact, a mutual, indirect marriage proposal. From two characters who each previously explicitly state (and demonstrate) that they lack the ability to think towards the future. In an earlier episode, Chitanda says that anyone, given the information, can get good grades, but she wants to see the "big picture". It's applying the knowledge to something useful she struggles with, as seen by her unexpectedly childish behaviour for a top student. And yet, by the end of the show, she does manage to show mature thinking, showing that she understands her place as the only child of the Chitanda residence. I think that this is the reason Kyoani chose to use the doll procession as the mystery for this episode. It highlights Chitanda's role in her family that she has (correctly) chosen to fulfill. The doll festival mystery is also the first mystery in which Chitanda has already figured out the answer, and only asks Oreki for verification.

As for Oreki, he compared himself to his sister back in episode 5, after she told him that ten years down the line, she wouldn't regret travelling, even with the difficulties that it brings (it was said that she got mugged). It seems that Oreki has never before considered if he would have any regrets or not.

A: Japanese idiom meaning to reach a wild conclusion

**** Little birds can remember + Aster Flowers
#+attr_shortcode: "(Satoshi) Vol. 4, Story 7, Chp 5"
#+begin_pquote
"It was a perfect shot, with the cherry blossom in it."

I stayed silent. Satoshi grinned and added,

"Based on your type, you just can't bear to say something like 'Make me a copy for commemoration's sake', right? But don't worry, I'll give you one even if you don't say it."
#+end_pquote

#+html: {{< figure src="/img/hyouka/little-birds.png" >}}

The above shot is from the very last scene of the anime. I hypothesize that the specific flower used in Hyouka is most likely some species (of many) under the genus /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aster_(genus)][Aster]]/. Here's an image of the same type of flowers (most likely) where they are blooming, used in the OP. I already included the image while talking about something else [[Withered Flowers, When examined - Ego depletion][back here]], however I will include it again in case you want to conserve some energy by not having to scroll up (reference to Oreki intended):

#+html: {{< figure src="/img/hyouka/flowers.png" >}}

In [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanakotoba][hanakotoba]], the /Aster/ represents remembrance (well, specifically the /Aster tataricus/, but we'll generalize the statement to all Asters). Rather than just general remembrance, it seems that the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aster_tataricus#In_culture][specific meaning]] is "I won't forget you." You can see why an /Aster/ is a reasonable guess for the flower here. Not only does it look similar to the animated one, it's symbolism is directly correlated to the very words on the screen that show up beside them: "Little birds can remember." (which, by the way, is once again a reference to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephants_Can_Remember][another Agatha Christie novel]]).

Another interesting note is that there are four flowers in the end scene compared to three from the scene in the OP that has been playing for the past couple episodes. Since the flowers in the OP represent Chitanda, Mayaka, and Satoshi (see [[Withered Flowers, When examined - Ego depletion][Withered Flowers, When Examined]]), we can assume the extra flower used in the ending scene represents Houtarou.

In the scene from the OP, the flowers are in bloom but seen to be growing in between cracks on the sidewalk. They seem to be having some difficulties, the main one in the middle even has it's roots exposed. Comparing these to the ones in the ending shot, we see that they are much more nourished. There is an abundance of grass around them, showing that the soil is abounding with nutrients. I've said earlier that I see Hyouka as primarily a coming of age story. The ending scene wraps it up brilliantly, showing four new sprouts of flowers getting ready to bloom, resolved in their future now that their problems have been (at least somewhat) ameliorated.

"So at the very least, I wanted to, how'd you put it, solve the riddle. I wanted to have a taste of your way of life."

I shut my mouth after that. Amidst the sound of the pedals and the breeze, Satoshi said nothing. Satoshi was normally talkative, yet there were times when he couldn't say anything, and I was quite mindful of that, as I wanted him to say something.

[fn:daughter-of-time] The Japanese title for the first novel in the series is /Hyouka/, literally meaning 'ice-cream' (those who read it or watched the anime will know!). The subtitle of the novel (/You can't escape/, later changed to /The niece of time/) is a reference to the mystery novel /The Daughter of Time/ by Josephine Tey, which similarily to Hyouka, deals with a historical mystery. In both novels, the detective (Alan in Tey's novel and Houtarou in Hyouka) is given historical renderings containing limited information about a past event. Both detectives have dubious thoughts about the popular opinion explaining the outcome, and eventually use logic to deduce a truthful explanation.

[fn:4] Freud's theories are widely disputed, especially his ideas of the Oedipus and Electra complexes (see a [[http://localhost:1313/blog/slow-cold-chick/#fn:2][footnote from another post]] for more info).

[fn:5] This is why individuals will continue gambling even if they lose money, for example. The mere possibility of reward or success is a motivator. See reference[fn:6] for a simulated study with rats.

[fn:6]  Mesolimbic dopamine signals the value of work (Hamid et al. 2015), /Nature Neuroscience/. Simplified summary of the paper: In this 2015 study, rats were given an adaptive decision-making task of either moving left or right of a port, each with seperate, variable reward possibilties of being rewarded a food pellet. They were found that when the reward rate was set higher, the rats responded faster, thus were more motivated. There's also a lot more interesting findings in the paper, and I suggest you read it in full.

[fn:7] Correlation does not imply causation. A causal relationship cannot be proved (it can only be inferred) from two correlated events without making logical fallacies. Consider the following cases:1. When I take caffeine, I feel less tired. This means that my lack of energy is due to a lack of caffeine (Reverse causality fallacy, cause and effect are not bidirectional. Just because caffeine makes you feel less tired does not mean that the tiredness is /caused/ by lack of caffeine)2. Increases in sales of Christmas decorations are strongly correlated with more cases of colds. Therefore, Christmas decorations cause cold. (This example fails to take into account the possible presence of a third factor which is the cause of both the increase in sales and the cases of cold, in this case, the winter season. This is called a "spurious relationship" in mathematics).

[fn:8] Hamid, A. A., Pettibone, J. R., Mabrouk, O. S., Hetrick, V. L., Schmidt, R., Vander Weele, C. M., ... Berke, J. D. (2015). Mesolimbic dopamine signals the value of work.

[fn:9] This is in contrast to Freud and other psychoanalytic psychologists who look at the unconscious mental and internal psyche.

[fn:10] For those not versed in psychology, there are two major types of behavioural conditioning: Classical or Pavlovian conditioning, which uses a neural stimulus to create a conditioned response. Operant conditioning is another type of conditioning where behaviours leading to positive outcomes will increase, and behaviours leading to negative outcomes will decrease. Basically this means that behaviours are goal driven.

[fn:11] When talking with less knowledgable individuals, competant individuals will oftentimes assume that other individuals are competant enough to understand them, that is, assume that others are as competent as themselves. This stems from the fact that the competent individual assumes that because they can do something easily, everyone else should also be able to. As individuals improve at a task, their perceived standards go up. This is also why sometimes if you are rushed and leave a memo to yourself in shorthand to remember something, it may make perfect sense to you at the time you wrote it, but later you may totally forget what you meant.

[fn:12] An example of the usage of self expectation in emotional blackmail could be trying to make the other person feel bad for us (eg: "I'll be sad if you don't!"). An example of usage of the expectations of others could be trying to convince them that they have a duty or responsiblity to cater to the task (eg: "What kind of friend wouldn't do it!"). See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_emotion][argument from passion]].

[fn:13] Unfortunately, in both the anime and the novel (ep 1 and Vol 4, Story 1 respectively), Satoshi doesn't elaborate much on the reasoning behind his point (probably because he needs to cross the road on time). It is possible that he said this purely coincidentally, but in my opinion it is much more likely that he saw something between Houtarou and Chitanda. If it is the second case, then Satoshi is right because the Silk Spider mystery, in Chitanda's eyes at least, established the fact that Houtarou was a good mystery solver, which directly led her to get him involved in the Sekitani Jun mystery and a whole lot of other ones costing him a lot of energy. However, if the first case is true, then there is the possibility that the whole thing is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-fulfilling_prophecy][self-fulfilling prophecy]] where Houtarou took Satoshi's words as truth and thus believes he is powerless to prevent it from happening.

[fn:14] As usual, KyoAni's visuals and shot structure is stunning, and clearly shows Houtarou's dillemma in this scene.

[fn:violence] Tomoe Oreki (Hotarou's sister) is said to be specialized in a form of martial arts called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiho_Jutsu][Taiho-jutsu]], said by Hotarou to be "pretty painful if one has intent to hurt".

[fn:18] The subtitle for the second volume ("Why didn't she ask Eba?") is a reference to this novel, although in the afterword the author indicates that the story is actually inspired by Anthony Berkely's /The Poisoned Chocolates Case/, and that Christie's novel doesn't come into the story.

[fn:19] We can assume that it's Tomoe because of the contents of the text messages at the beginning and end of the volume. Irisu (nicknamed 'Anonymous') chats with an individual named 'A.ta.shi♪' via the Kamiyama High internal student chat, who mentions she is travelling on the other side of the world. She also listens to Irisu's problem and recommends her a person for the task, which we can assume is Houtarou.

sexist "pseudoscience" (1). There are many reasons for this, including
dubious, untestable ideas, unethicality of some of the claims, and lack
of scientific support, all of which are quite justified (2). However,
while some of Freud's proposals may very well be considered far-fetched,
many of his fundamental ideas are still applicable to multiple fields,
and are the foundation of most modern theories around personality and
the psyche. This paper will attempt to explore potential uses of
psychoanalytic theory in the interpretation of literature, particularly
personality of characters in fiction. It will be using Nalo Hopkinson's
short story 'Slow Cold Chick' (from the anthology published as Skin
Folk) (3) as an example. It will do so from the perspective of
psychoanalysis being a real social science, much like psychology. This
means viewing it from the perspective of provable hypotheses, and as
such, the paper will be referencing many famous academic papers around
the area of personality and psychology. The paper will primarily focus
on how our unconscious thoughts affect our decisions, using proven
examples such as cognitive biases[fn:1], and how this influences an
individual's personality.

*** Whats in a person?
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: whats-in-a-person
  :END:
There are various theories on personality. Some are rooted in sound
evidence and studies, while others are merely speculations. While there
is no solid definition of personality (6), psychologists agree that
analysis of personality involves answering the following two questions
(6): "what are we like (usually in comparison to others)?" and "why are
we like that?". The first of these two is relatively easy to answer (6)
and can be done through a multitude of ways such as self-reflection,
asking a close friend, taking a reputable personality quiz, or the like.
It is the answer to the second question that psychologists don't agree
upon (6), and is precisely the question that psychoanalysis tries to
answer. Sigmund Freud is often attributed as the founder of
psychoanalysis with his highly controversial book (1) The Interpretation
of Dreams (7). The book introduces the concepts of the "probing the
unconscious", specifically through assigning meaning to dreams (1) and
other streams of preconscious thought (the "ego") (7). Moreover, the
book also introduces a highly socioculturally unethical argument of the
Oedipus and Electra complexes[fn:2], referring to unconscious sexual
attraction to the opposite gendered parent in a developing child (4 to 7
years old). This causes what Freud called "castration anxiety" in males,
and "penis envy" in females (6)(7), in other words, the desire to
replace the same gendered parent. He proposed that this is the reason
the males identify more with their father, and females with their
mother, they learn from the same gendered parent in hopes of replacing
them one day. Now this probably sounds quite far-fetched and
unreasonable, and that's exactly why it received so much criticism
(1)(8)(9).

While the theory may be unworkable for scientific usage, the fundamental
concepts are perfectly sound for literary criticism. By utilizing
Freudian notions of the behaviour of thoughts at the conscious (the
"superego"), the preconscious (the "ego"), and the subconscious (the
"id") levels (6)(7)(see 15 for explanation of these), we can possibly
derive new meaning from text, and alternative interpretations of the
decisions of characters. This paper will focus on applying the idea that
subconscious and preconscious mental processes affect conscious,
rational decision making, and will use psychoanalysis to analyze themes
from Nalo Hopkinson's 'Slow Cold Chick' (3) to demonstrate this.

*** Cognitive Bias and Consciousness
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: cognitive-bias-and-consciousness
  :END:
Psychologists define rationality, specifically epistemic rationality as
the ability to form beliefs that align with truth, and also avoid those
which are conducive of error (12). It has been proven time and time
again that our minds are not perfectly rational (13). Imagine this case:
A large company is building a new transportation system. In the middle
of building the system, it is found that ultimately, the company will
lose money. However, the company keeps investing because they are "too
far into it to quit". (Sunk cost fallacy[fn:3]). Or another case: A rare
virus has a 0.1% infection rate. A test for this virus has a 10% false
positive rate (and thus a 90% accuracy rate). If an individual tests
positive for the virus, what is the probability they have the virus?
Someone without knowledge of statistics would probably say 90%. After
all, the test is 90% accurate, right? It turns out that this is
incorrect. If you did the math, you would find that you were
significantly off; the actual chance of the tested individual having the
disease is 1%. (Base rate fallacy[fn:4]). The point is that our minds
are flawed due to unconscious errors in thought, which in turn affects
our conscious thinking and "rational" decision making. These are called
cognitive biases (4), and are undesirable most of the time due to the
errors it can produce (but apparently also sometimes advantageous, see
14). They can be overridden through conscious thought if the decision
maker is aware of the bias. While these biases themselves aren't
actually important in our discussion of 'Slow Cold Chick', the point is
that our unconscious thoughts very often affect conscious decision
making. In the case of literary works, viewing texts by analyzing the
thoughts of characters can possibly lead to a deeper understanding of
the unconscious motivations behind their decisions, which in turn can
bring out new themes in a work.

In psychology, psychoanalysis is typically performed in sessions where
the patient expresses free thoughts and feelings to the therapist. The
therapist will try and piece together unconscious conflicts using many
techniques, some of which are described in Freud's previously mentioned
book The Interpretation of Dreams (7). In addition to the ones described
in Freud's books, some newer techniques were added by other therapists
over time[fn:5]. We will be using the techniques described to analyze
the character of Blaise.

Freud's ideas of the three levels of consciousness[fn:6] are
instrumental to his explanation of personality. In order to perform
psychoanalysis of Blaise in 'Slow Cold Chick', we will firstly attempt
to infer unconscious aspects of Blaise's character (her "id") through
elements given to us by the author. In the story, we see that Blaise is
struggling with trying to hold in her identity and emotions. At the
start of the story, Blaise is angry, supposedly at her telephone:
"'Oonuh couldn't wait just a little more?', she asked resentfully of the
silent instrument" (3). We can infer that this is a paid phone in which
there is a set time limit depending on the amount of money you pay,
evident by Blaise's repeated reference to the fact that she will get
paid on Friday, and the use of the third person pronoun "they" in the
first sentence, implying that neither Blaise nor whoever she was talking
to was the one who hung up. Also the use of the phrase "cut off" only
makes sense in this context. In the next lines, we are told that she
"couldn't ask her mother to put milk or water in the cornbread" (3),
establishing Blaise's mother as the other person on the phone, and also
establishing the reason behind her anger: she wanted to ask her mother
whether milk or water should go into the cornbread, but was interrupted
by the cutoff time on the phone. The emotion of her anger would be
associated with the psychoanalytic notion of the id, part of her
unconscious impulsive desires present from birth.

*** Venus, Vulcan, and a Chicken
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: venus-vulcan-and-a-chicken
  :END:
We see in the story that both the Venus-built lady (later introduced as
Sharon) and Johnny are both allusions to Roman mythology, with Sharon
being compared to the Roman goddess of love and fertility (Venus), and
Johnny being compared to the Roman god of fire and metalworking
(Vulcan). These are pretty evident in the descriptions given of the
characters: Sharon is directly stated to be a "Venus-built lady", and
Johnny is described as having the "texture of chipped rock" (3) and is
also said to be a metalworker. Keep in mind that these are the
descriptions of the two from Blaise's perspective, they may or may not
be completely accurate, and the important notion is that Blaise's
perceptions of these characters will be influenced by her unconscious
thoughts. If we examine the descriptions closer, we can gain some more
insight into the psychology of Blaise. For Sharon, we see that Blaise
describes her using adjectives such as indolent, beautiful, and
self-possessed. She also uses phrases appealing to the physical and
sexual desires, especially focusing on the mouth, things like
"nasturtiums that pursed into succulent lips", and "so low that the lady
could have plucked them with her mouth". Further phrases such as
"gingered brown hair flung itself in crinkled dreadknots down her back,
tangled as lovers' fingers", "skin had the glow of full-fat chocolate",
and "flower-breathed words" reveal to us even more of this sexual
vocabulary.

From here we can make an inference: perhaps Blaise is sexually attracted
to Sharon? This certainly seems possible given the repeated references
to possibly sexual symbolism. After comparing how Blaise views the males
in the story, her next door neighbour and Johnny, we see that this could
very well be the case. Johnny is described to be physically appealing.
We see Hopkinson use diction such as "tanned shoulders", "corded
muscles", and "wiry strength". However, Blaise describes him as "Not
handsome, but striking", indicating that she is not romantically
attracted to him. This also explains why she is so angry when her
neighbour comes under the pretense of "wanting company" but really after
her body. In addition, Blaise also acts embarrassed upon physical
contact with Sharon ("Sharon slid an arm around Blaise's waist. Blaise
relaxed into the touch, then caught herself. Ears burning, she eased
away"), and seems to repeatedly make remarks about Sharon's scent and
demeanor ("a part of her still aware of Sharon's rosiness and
duskiness") . Just by looking at Blaise's (likely unconscious)
perceptions and interactions with these three individuals, it is
becoming increasingly likely that Blaise is attracted to other
individuals of the same sex as her.

Next, let's take a look at the cocatrice and the other animal (a ferret)
which are mentioned in the story. Blaise's cocatrice first emerges from
out of a rotten egg. The chick quickly grows until it is about the size
of a spaniel, and is capable of killing and eating a ferret. Freud
proposed that there were five psychosexual stages in the development of
personality (6), and that problems during any of the stages will lead to
specific behavioural and personality characteristics, some of which are
problematic[fn:7]. The development of the cocatrice seems to start off
normally, then halt after the oral stage (first stage). It starts from
licking some pepper sauce (oral), then skips the anal stage. The phallic
stage is hard to judge. The gender of the chick is not specified, so it
is unclear whether or not the chick will develop an Oedipus or Electra
complex. However, the main developmental task for this stage is
identification with one of the parents, leading to the development of
the superego (6). The chick evidently does not have a moral compass,
neither does it have control over its animalistic, violent, and sexual
desires. It killed Blaise's neighbour and his ferret without second
thought. However, note that these stages are not important or crucial
for psychoanalysis, which focuses on the effect of unconscious thought.
Additionally, there is very little scientific base for these stages and
they have not been observed or confirmed in children (19). Regardless,
Hopkinson makes it fairly clear that the cockatrice represents Blaise's
conflict with her sexual desires and aggressive drive (in Freudian
terms, called the "id") (6). We can see this in the fact that it
incinerated Blaise's neighbour and his ferret, which was what Blaise's
instinctive and basic desires wanted to do. On some level of her
consciousness, she wholeheartedly wanted to get rid of him for good
("Why couldn't he ever take a hint? She wished he'd just dry up and fly
away."). She would have killed him herself if her "ego", the
preconscious governed by the reality principle, were not there to keep
her "id" in check. This explains why the chick, with no development of
moral compass or any level of consciousness beyond the "id" due to
fixation in the anal and phallic stages, took action and incinerated the
neighbour and his ferret.

We see that the connection with Blaise and the cockatrice is also true
for the neighbour and his ferret. If the cockatrice represents Blaise's
sexual and aggressive drive, then it is reasonable to think that this
extended metaphor is applicable to the ferret as well. The ferret is
described as being furtively "slinky", reminiscent of "a furry penis
with teeth". This sexual imagery is used to reinforce the metaphor that,
at least at the most basic, primitive level of thought, Blaise's
neighbour is interested in sexual desires around Blaise's body. In terms
of the symbolism side of things, a cockatrice is a mythical creature
said to be capable of killing by a stare. According to bestiaries from
the late-medieval period, weasels are the only animal immune to a
cockatrice (20). As ferrets are a mammal closely genetically related to
weasels (21), this is likely not an accident by Hopkinson. The weasel
that is supposed to be the nemesy of the cockatrice, the only animal it
cannot kill with a stare, is swiftly dealt with.This shows the degree of
Blaise's feelings and anger she has kept inside.

Given this point of context, we can see the seemingly random events of
the ending and resolution of Blaise's conflict come together into a
meaningful message. After telling Sharon and Johnny the events behind
the cockatrice, she takes them to her apartment, where Johnny faces the
cockatrice in an attempt to kill it. This is symbolic of the struggle
Blaise has been facing. The cockatrice, a physical representation of her
homosexual desires, is undergoing a one on one struggle with a male. A
handsome, Vulcan-like male at that. The rest of the ending is thus
fairly self-explanatory. When the cockatrice starts dying, Blaise "felt
warmth begin to drain from her body". Sharon replies with: "You want to
kill your every desire dead?" Blaise realizes that she is empty without
the cockatrice, empty without her desires. Later in the end, Blaise
finally tells it what she wants: "I want to be able to say [...] 'I like
you'". Blaise swallowing the cockatrice and getting her "fire" back is
representative of her new confidence in her identity. She remarks that
she feels "Strong, sure of herself", and also makes a comment about the
way Sharon's position healing Johnny's blisters "emphasized the fullness
of her body", another reference to her homosexual identity.

*** Defense mechanisms
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: defense-mechanisms
  :END:
Freud's version of psychoanalysis is also very concerned with what he
called defense mechanisms, which can indicate possible points of
fixation[fn:8]. There is a blatantly obvious use of one of these
mechanisms in the story. When on her walk to the animal shelter in an
attempt to rid herself of the cockatrice, she is interrupted by Sharon
asking her to help with garden work. Here's the excuse Blaise uses to
help them instead of dealing with the cockatrice: "The problem was too
big for her to deal with for a moment. With an 'Um, okay,' she chose
denial". We see two of Freud's main defense mechanisms in play here,
denial and rationalization, which often go together. By agreeing to help
her neighbours when she still has the cockatrice to deal with, she is
denying the fact that she has a problem, refusing to believe that there
was bad news. She rationalizes this decision with the fact that the
problem is too big for her to deal with for the moment. Of course, the
irony and logical fallacy in her argument is that the bigger the
problem, the sooner she should deal with it. As we continue with the day
spent helping Sharon and Johnny, we see that Blaise uses the defense
mechanisms of denial and rationalization once again. She makes the
assumption that the cockatrice is asleep: "The shelter would be closed,
but probably the cockatrice was asleep by now". She assumes that because
of the absence of dire outcomes from the cockatrice since the time she
came to help Sharon, the cockatrice would be asleep. This is full of
logical errors. She makes an incorrect causality attribution [fn:9], and
also makes an argument from silence[fn:10]. We can see that she is using
these defense mechanisms in order to avoid the cockatrice. A Freudian
psychoanalyst would say that her unconscious "id" is trying to get her
away from unreasonable desires (in this case, her attraction to members
of the same sex). This could possibly be due to fixation at the phallic
Freudian stage[fn:7], when she did not correctly develop an Electra
complex[fn:12][fn:7] for her male parent. We can further develop on
this by taking into account Blaise's relationship with her mother at the
beginning of the story. She is clearly 'identifying', as Freudians would
say, with her mother, as she is trying to make cornbread like how her
mother made it. Another clue is that she was previously talking with her
mother on the phone before it cut off, about an unstated topic. The
subject matter of the talk is not important, the main idea is that she
has a relationship with her mother, presumably a fairly good one. What's
important to realize here is that, in the Freudian view of a
psychologically healthy adult, Blaise is perfectly normal (at least
before she starts sexually describing Sharon). This furthers the idea
that Blaise is holding her true desires in, possibly masking it with
attempts to become 'normal', so much that she is developing an Electra
complex, and identification with the same-sex parent. The symbolism
behind Blaise hiding the fact of cockatrice from Sharon and Johnny at
first is also an indicator of this.

*** You are what you eat
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: you-are-what-you-eat
  :END:
In addition, we see food playing a big role in the extended metaphor of
the cockatrice and of Blaise's internal conflict. At the beginning of
the story, Blaise is trying to make her mother's cornbread, establishing
the previously stated attempts to become "normal" and the late
development of an Electra complex (which according to Freud, is
indicative of a mentally "normal" female). Cornbread reflects this as a
relatively normal food, at least compared to the roses and dirt that the
other characters eat. If we examine the foods in which the characters
eat and compare it to their personality, we see something interesting.
Blaise's neighbour is shown eating a "cheap chocolate bar" and is "lanky
and pimply". Sharon eats roses and has "aloe scented breath". Johnny
eats rock and dirt and has a "voice like gravel being ground". We can
see a pattern: you are what you eat in this fictional world. Looking at
the objects Blaise eats, the cornbread she is trying to replicate from
her mother represents, as stated above, her attempts to become 'normal'
as it is a relatively normal food. This is reinforced even more by the
previously mentioned ideas about the connection with her mother through
a developing Electra complex. At the end of the story, we see that she
swallows the cockatrice. This is indicative of the change that occurred
throughout the story. At the beginning, she is trying to fit in, holding
back her true desires. At the end of the story, she now consumes the
cockatrice, albeit unwillingly, but it shows us that she has now come to
terms with her actual desires. Following the paradigm of 'you are what
you eat', we see the shift from the previous state of the Electra
complex and trying to be 'normal' (eating cornbread to be like her
mother) has now disappeared and Blaise has learned to embrace what she
actually wants (eating the cockatrice). In addition to performing
psychoanalysis on the characters in the story itself, we must also
examine the story through the lens of the author using the literary work
as a means of unconscious expression, much like a dream[fn:14].
Therefore, we must consider the author's intent behind writing the
story. In an excerpt[fn:15] from Nalo Hopkinson taken from Skin Folk
(the collection of stories where 'Slow Cold Chick' was originally
published with), Hopkinson tells us that "it seemed that all I could see
was the sex and the violence. 'Slow Cold Chick' is the result of my
effort to restrain those twin energies". This is consistent with our
predictions of the cockatrice being a physical representation of
Blaise's sexual desires. Sexual topics are also a big part of other
stories in Skin Folk as well.

Literary analysis, at least from a psychoanalytic perspective, is just
predictions, which is why it is so comparable to psychoanalytic therapy.
We look for things such as patterns, literary elements, etc. from the
text in hopes of deriving meaning from the text. We hope that it is what
the author intended, but even if it isn't we still succeeded in gaining
something from the text. Psychoanalysis in therapeutic psychology is
really the same thing. Freudian ideas such as "probing the unconscious"
is really just sugar for guessing meaning out of a series of random
thoughts from the client. It is guessing because after you have derived
meaning, no matter how sure you may be that you are right, correlation
is not causation[fn:16], so you can never get to be 100% sure of the
root cause just from probing thoughts alone. This is incidentally, one
of the reasons why psychoanalysis is not used scientifically anymore.
However, as we have seen in this paper, the psychology of both the
characters and the author is very important in determining the themes
and meaning of a story. 'Slow Cold Chick' could and has been (see 22)
interpreted in many different ways by different people, using differing
forms of literary analysis.

All in all, we see that although the use of psychoanalysis is limited in
the scientific realm, it is still very useful for literary analysis of
fictional characters. As we have shown with analysis of 'Slow Cold
Chick', we cannot deny that the Freudian notions of the unconscious mind
affect our conscious perceptions and decisions. This is made especially
apparent with the appearance and symbolic significance of the cockatrice
and it's development, which we earlier inferred to be lacking a
superego. By performing psychoanalysis on the author and characters, and
analyzing the specific choices of symbols and diction used by Hopkinson
along with using some logic, we were able to piece together a fairly
complete picture of Blaise, her life, and her change throughout the
story. This leaves us with a more complete understanding of the
emotions, themes, and pictures Hopkinson expresses throughout the story.
Hopkinson teaches us to embrace our desires, even if we need to swallow
a cockatrice to do so. In a world where eating roses makes you pretty
and eating rocks makes you tough, remember that you can't settle with
just cornbread.

Most of these notes are small summaries. Direct quotes are wrapped with

[fn:1] "By cognitive bias, we mean cases in which human cognition
       reliably produces representations that are systematically
       distorted compared to some aspect of objective reality." (4)

[fn:2] The ideas of the Oedipus and Electra complexes developing in the
       Phallic stage are the most disputed parts of psychoanalytic
       theory. The Oedipus complex refers to the unconscious sexual
       desire of a male child for his mother. The Electra complex is the
       opposite, referring to the unconscious sexual desire of a female
       child for her father. (6) These complexes have some partial
       scientific support for them, but are for the most part heavily
       scientifically criticized. Moreover, the complexes require that
       two parents of opposite sex are present for successful mental
       development of a child, disregarding family structures that are
       not this way (eg: single parent families, same-sex parent
       families, etc.). In a quote from Steven Pinker's book How the
       mind works: "The idea that boys want to sleep with their mothers
       strikes most men as the silliest thing they have ever heard.
       Obviously, it did not seem so to Freud, who wrote that as a boy
       he once had a erotic reation to watching this mother dressing. Of
       note is that Amalia Nathansohn Freud [Freud's mother] was
       relatively young during Frued's childhood and thus of
       reproductive age, and Freud having a wet-nurse, may not have
       experienced the early intimacy that would have tipped off his
       perceptual system that Mrs. Freud was his mother." (25)

[fn:3] A 'sunk cost' refers to a past loss that cannot be recovered.
       When making a decision, only the future implications should be
       considered. However, very often when making decisions, we will
       let sunk costs influence our judgment. (10)

[fn:4] The assumption that someone who tested positive has the disease
       is 90% is solely based on the false positive rate of the test,
       overlooking the infection rate which is 0.1%. Imagine that 10000
       people were tested. Since the test has a 10% false positive rate,
       1000 people would test positive. Since the infection rate is
       0.1%, only 10 people in the 10 000 would actually have the
       disease. Therefore the chances that you test positive and have
       the disease are 10/1000 = 1%, much lower than 90%. (11)

[fn:5] Freud and other proponents of psychoanalysis have developed two
       main techniques in order to probe the unconscious and identify
       possible unresolved conflicts leading to problems. Free
       association, where a client expresses their conscious thoughts
       and feelings as they occur, usually verbally or in writing, and
       dream interpretation, where the therapist interprets symbolic
       meaning of the client's dreams. Once a client expresses their
       conscious thoughts through these, the therapist will employ
       logical analysis and countertransference (see note 7) to look for
       resistance, the Freudian idea that a client will use unconscious
       defense mechanisms to avoid topics they are uncomfortable with.
       (18)

[fn:6] Freud proposed that our consciousness consisted of three levels:
       (6) • The "id": The unconscious level, consists of animalistic
       and evolutionary instincts (sexual and aggressive drive) which
       are governed by pleasure. Present at birth. Fears, sexual
       desires, and violent motives are at this level. • The "ego":
       Exists between the conscious and subconscious levels. Consists of
       thoughts that you are not normally aware of, but can easily be
       brought to consciousness. Governed by reality, acts to keep the
       "id" in check. Develops in early childhood prior to the
       "superego". Memories are stored at this level. • The "superego":
       The conscious level, consists of morality. Develops the latest
       and is governed by the "ego ideal", the standard socially
       accepted morals which a child learns as they are developing (How
       should you behave?). Thoughts and perceptions are at this level.

[fn:7] Freud's psychosexual stages consisted of the following phases (in
       chronological order). Each of the phases contain a developmental
       task where some task must be properly completed to move to the
       next stage. Freud also proposed that fixation can occur at any of
       the stages, creating unresolved conflict that can possibly cause
       personality problems later (6)

[fn:8] Freud proposed that there was a correlation between certain
       behaviours exhibited by a patient, and the cause of their
       fixation. He called these defense mechanisms (6), and believed
       that these were unconscious attempts to prevent unacceptable
       thoughts coming from the id reaching conscious awareness, and
       thus creates a "resistance", or avoidance of certain
       uncomfortable topics that could be the cause of the fixation (eg:
       a patient with psychological problems due to an abusive father
       may unconsciously avoid the topic of parenting and other
       associated topics). Freud defined a couple types of possible
       defense mechanisms (6), which incidentally are similar to
       argument criticisms involving logic and rhetoric fallacies
       (informal fallacies, see reference 23) because they all divert
       the argument to something irrelevant, or implicitly assume that a
       fact is true when in reality it isn't (7): • Denial: Refusing to
       believe bad news. Reacting to anxiety or other negative stimuli
       by saying that the stimuli doesn't exist (an argument from
       silence, see footnote 13) • Displacement: Taking out impulses on
       less threatening targets (eg: slamming a door instead of hitting
       a person) • Intellectualization: Avoiding unacceptable emotions
       by focusing on intellectual aspects (reasoning through something
       looking only "at the good side") • Projection: Attributing
       unacceptable impulses onto someone else (eg: the 'your just
       stupid' parnoia used after losing an argument) • Rationalization:
       Attempting to rationalize through the situation with a reason
       other than the true one (eg: stating you were fired because you
       didn't talk to your boss when the real reason was poor
       performance) • Reaction formation: Taking the opposite action or
       belief than the one you take to heart because of anxiety (eg:
       Doing something you don't want to do because everyone else is
       doing it) • Repression: Putting thoughts which cause anxiety into
       the unconscious, purposely forgetting something • Sublimation:
       Acting out unacceptable impulses in a socially acceptable way
       (eg: lifting weights to release pent up anger)

[fn:9] Causation is not correlation, or "cum hoc ergo propter hoc" in
       Latin, is a well known saying that means exactly what it sounds
       like. Causation cannot be proved (it can only be inferred) from
       correlation alone without making logical fallacies. Consider the
       following cases with incorrect assumptions (6): • When I take
       caffeine, I feel less tired. This means that my lack of energy is
       due to a lack of caffeine (Reverse causality fallacy, cause and
       effect are not bidirectional. Just because caffeine makes you
       feel less tired does not mean that the tiredness is caused by
       lack of caffeine) • Increases in sales of Christmas decorations
       are strongly correlated with more cases of the colds. Therefore,
       Christmas decorations cause colds. (This example fails to take
       into account the possible presence of a third factor which is the
       cause of both the increase in sales of decorations and the cases
       of colds, in this case, the winter season. This is called a
       "spurious relationship" in mathematics) (24)

[fn:10] An argument from silence, or in Latin, "argumentum ex silentio"
  (6), is drawing a concluding fact based on the absence of a
  statement, argument, or reference to something. They are
  generally considered weak arguments as they rely primarily on
  the assumption that the missing reference is both in the
  interest of the author or the work to express, and also
  important enough to warrant that the author should have made a
  reference. Both of these are opinionated assumptions that are
  difficult to solidly prove. Silence in literary works is also
  typically associated with purposeful ignorance, in which case
  the argument from silence would be void.

[fn:12] The ideas of the Oedipus and Electra complexes developing in the
  Phallic stage are the most disputed parts of psychoanalytic
  theory. The Oedipus complex refers to the unconscious sexual
  desire of a male child for his mother. The Electra complex is
  the opposite, referring to the unconscious sexual desire of a
  female child for her father. (6) These complexes have some
  partial scientific support for them, but are for the most part
  heavily scientifically criticized. Moreover, the complexes
  require that two parents of opposite sex are present for
  successful mental development of a child, disregarding family
  structures that are not this way (eg: single parent families,
  same-sex parent families, etc.). In a quote from Steven Pinker's
  book How the mind works: "The idea that boys want to sleep with
  their mothers strikes most men as the silliest thing they have
  ever heard. Obviously, it did not seem so to Freud, who wrote
  that as a boy he once had a erotic reation to watching this
  mother dressing. Of note is that Amalia Nathansohn Freud
  [Freud's mother] was relatively young during Frued's childhood
  and thus of reproductive age, and Freud having a wet-nurse, may
  not have experienced the early intimacy that would have tipped
  off his perceptual system that Mrs. Freud was his mother." (25)

[fn:14] In Freud's theory, a literary work and a dream are no different.
  They are both outward manifestations of inner feelings and
  desires, and thus analyzing fictional works the same way as a
  psychoanalytic therapist would interpret dreams will bring out
  the conflicts in the author's unconscious, which Freud believed
  to be the true meaning of a text. (6)

[fn:15] "The radio arm of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation was once
  looking for emerging writers from whom to commission new
  fiction. Writer Olive Senior recommended me to them. CBC Radio
  asked me for a story, but cautioned me that I'd have to 'watch
  the sex and the violence,' since it was public radio (in fact,
  they said that they were actually more worried about the sex
  since they got way more angry phone calls about sexual content
  in their programmes than about violence). But after that
  warning, it seemed that all I could see was the sex and the
  violence. 'Slow Cold Chick' is the result of my effort to
  restrain those twin energies." • Nalo Hopkinson, excerpt from
  Skin Folk. Intro blurb to 'Slow Cold Chick' (3)

[fn:16] Causation is not correlation, or "cum hoc ergo propter hoc" in
  Latin, is a well known saying that means exactly what it sounds
  like. Causation cannot be proved (it can only be inferred) from
  correlation alone without making logical fallacies. Consider the
  following cases with incorrect assumptions (6): • When I take

  is due to a lack of caffeine (Reverse causality fallacy, cause
  and effect are not bidirectional. Just because caffeine makes
  you feel less tired does not mean that the tiredness is caused
  by lack of caffeine) • Increases in sales of Christmas
  decorations are strongly correlated with more cases of the
  colds. Therefore, Christmas decorations cause colds. (This
  example fails to take into account the possible presence of a
  third factor which is the cause of both the increase in sales of
  decorations and the cases of colds, in this case, the winter

** Why Artificial Consciousness may be possible :@AI:philosophy:psychology:intelligence:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: consciousness
:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :status inprogress
:END:
It is commonly accepted that machines are not and cannot be conscious, and that any perceived consciousness is merely an imitation of organic consciousness. While I don't disagree with these claims, there is not much solid proof for them, though of course, the same is true for the converse. However, it is still worth considering both sides of the problem. Therefore, for arguments sake, this article will lay out a series of examples and thought experiments potentially proving that artificial conscious /could be/ possible. 'Could be' because I am of the opinion that, as of right now, consciousness cannot be concretely proved [fn:: This depends on what consciousness actually entails, a few of which are discussed in this article. If we define consciousness as a first-person experience, then we cannot prove if anything apart from ourselves is conscious, because we cannot (at least currently) experience what another consious entity is experiencing. Additionally, consciousness is a spectrum rather than a discrete yes-or-no classification, and has an indeterminate area in the middle in which makes it difficult to discern a threshold for a decision boundary.], and may never be unless we find a reliable way to functionally link two brains (perhaps with a neurostimulator similar to transcranial ultrasound[fn:1]) and convey first-hand experience in real time. However, even if we are able to do this and find out that machines are in fact, not conscious, I describe some reasons why we should treat them as conscious anyways. Keep in mind that this is all for speculation and interest sake. I personally do not think that machines can be conscious. Don't take it too seriously.

*** Precursors to Consciousness
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: the-facts
  :END:
This section describes some elements of consciousness that are typically thought of as prerequisites, or at least indicators, of a conscious entity. We will see that only a few of these are actually justified to prove that machines cannot be conscious.

**** Awareness
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: awareness
   :END:
Despite the fact that there is a lot of debate about the definition of consciousness itself, there is one thing that nearly all everyone agrees that sentient entities must exhibit: awareness. In fact, awareness and consciousness are often used as synonyms. Unfortunately, this doesn't help us define consciousness because the definition of awareness is also blurred and debated as well. If we go by the definition that awareness means the knowledge that the experience oneself is having is real and concrete, an AI system driven by machine language instructions may or may not be aware. We have no way to prove that a machine has knowledge of the data it is computing, we can only speak from a outsider perspective. Therefore we cannot use awareness as definitive proof of whether an AI (or any information-processing system, this includes the brains of other humans) is conscious or not.

Additionally, from psychological studies done on very young infants, it doesn't appear that they exhibit awareness, at least in the traditional sense of the word. It is found that infants less than 12 months old fail the mirror test[fn:mirror-test], suggesting that infants have no concept that the world around them is concrete and "real", similar to an experience in a dream, which suggests that awareness may not be present from birth, or at least it evolves into what we traditionally think of it as. Young infants are certainly conscious, which means that consciousness is possible without "awareness", again speaking in the traditional, conversational sense of the word.

**** Self Awareness/Self Identity
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: self-awarenessself-identity
   :END:
There are a couple of approaches humans use to examine ourselves:

- Distinctiveness: How can I tell the difference between 'me' and others around me?
- Continuity: Am I the same person I was yesterday? 5 years ago? 10 years ago? 20 years ago?
- Identity: What am I, what do I believe, why do I believe that?

While we might think of self identity and awareness as something fundamental to consciousness, it turns out that this may not be the case. An important takeaway from psychological research on human self identity is that it develops over time. Children seem to give concrete aspects of who they are when asked to describe their identity (things like age, gender, where they live, and hobbies), whereas as they mature, less emphasis is placed on physical characteristics and more on psychological states, thoughts and feelings, how others perceive them. In other words, they are gain the ability to psychologically reflect on themselves, and move from concrete thinking to self-reflection. Infants also do not seem to possess a strong sense of self-awareness or identity, as described above.

Additionally, there has been some evidence for the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Discrepancy_Theory][self-discrepancy theory]], which states that we have three selves inside of us. Our actual self (how we actually are), our ideal self (how we would like to be), and an ought self (how we 'should' be according to social norms, peer pressure, or how we think we should act). You can see how these can usually be in direct conflict. However, evidence is conflicted, some studies have found support for this theory, whereas others report contradictory findings.

Another reason to discredit self-awareness as a prerequisite for consciousness is the fact that other lower level species don't appear to exhibit it, or certainly nowhere near to the same degree as humans do. The common test for this is the mirror test, whereby an animal is externally marked and then put in front of a mirror. If the animal reaches towards the physical mark on it's skin, rather than reaching towards the mirror, we have a possible indicator that it is self-aware. The test can be done through other ways in which senses other than vision are involved as well.

  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: can-an-airplane-fly-can-a-machine-think
  :END:
A common discussion topic when deciding whether machines are conscious is the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness][hard problem of consciousness]], that is, the problem of how humans and similar conscious entities have first person conscious experiences whereas inanimate objects (papers, pencils, toasters, and by extension, strong AI) don't. At least they don't appear to. This ultimately leads to the connection of consciousness with the neurobiology of the brain, the question of whether or not consciousness is purely determined by the chemical and physical composition of the brain organ.

This is important because if it turns out that inanimate objects do in fact, have subjective mental experiences (called qualia in philosophy), this means that we could classify any object as having some form of consciousness, including papers, pencils, toasters, or any form of AI and computer programs in general, which is obviously not the case. There are many potential solutions to this problem, which I will not detail here. In fact, as we later see, the answer to this shouldn't change the way in which we treat humanoid robots and similar AGI's.

One important thing to note is that consciousness is different from intelligence. Intelligence is simply the ability to acquire and use knowledge. There are also multiple facets of intelligence, such as logic and reasoning, understanding, learning and planning, problem solving, creativity, social intelligence, and emotional intelligence. By this definition, both humans and AI are intelligent. AI has the ability to take external data and learn from it to adapt itself to a particular goal, which classifies it as intelligent. There is little debate over this area, it is almost universally accepted that AI is intelligent, just currently less in scale than humans.

Obviously there is some correlation between conscious thoughts and the physical state of the brain. If you damage your neurobiological processes, elements of your psychology and consciousness will change correlationally (eg: If you drive a nail through your brain, your personality will change). However, when we talk of the property of consciousness itself, there may or may not be a correlation. What I mean is, the person with the nail through the brain is still conscious (until they lose too much blood and pass out, that is), just their personality will change. We also see this in cases like accident-induced amnesia, where individuals with damage to their brain lose various cognitive capabilities, such as memory.

*** Chinese Rooms can understand

  :END:

#+begin_quote
  The whole is greater than the parts.

  (Aristotle)
#+end_quote

John Searle's Chinese room thought experiment is commonly used to debunk artificial consciousness. The experiment goes like this: Suppose a non-Chinese speaker is in a room with a reference book that enables them to respond to any Chinese phrase into English and vice versa, at the level of human intelligence (in other words, it passes the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test][Turing test]]). Another Chinese-speaking individual outside the room slips a note written in Chinese through a slot in the door. The non-Chinese speaker then uses the book to create a reply and returns it to the individual outside, thereby convincing the individual that there is a Chinese speaker in the room.

Searle proposed that because the individual inside the room doesn't actually understand Chinese, the individual and room only create the illusion of understanding. Therefore, a strong AI may create the illusion of consciousness but is in reality just a program following instructions, thus artificial consciousness is impossible because no matter how intelligent an AI program is, it will always be, in reality, a Chinese room where the computer is merely following code.

One common argument against this is treating the contents to the room and the man inside as a system, and although the man himself may not understand Chinese, the man-room system as a whole does. The man is merely a utility in executing out the instructions from the book, and when the book is combined with the man, the system can "understand" Chinese. Searle replied to this by proposing the fact that if the man memorizes the handbook and does the exact same process, but in his head? He proposed that by linking the computation in one area, there is then no system, and the man himself still doesn't understand Chinese. This argument proves very little as it is still true that regardless of where the computation is taking place, the system as a whole still understands Chinese. Searle's argument also doesn't take into account the fact that the man himself has no need to understand Chinese for the entire system to be able to do so. This is much like how the atoms that make up a biological brain don't need to be conscious for the brain as a whole to be.

What the Chinese room argument ignores is the fact that /any/ algorithm causing behaviour and intelligence (and thus understanding), no matter how seemingly complex it is in the human mind, can be broken down into a network of fundamental AND and OR logic gates (which is incidentally the exact idea that deep learning methods like neural networks are built from[^logic gates]). Technically, if you wanted to, you could write a bunch of if-else statements to model a brain. Sufficiently complex interactions between parts can produce properties the parts don't have alone (see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence][here]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_order][here]]). There is no reason to believe that this doesn't extend to neurobiological processes. In other words, a sufficiently complex system (artificial or biological) can produce conscious phenomena. The Chinese room argument assumes that the room can never understand Chinese because consciousness is not emergent, that it can't be broken down into simple parts, when really consciousness emerges from a system of enough complexity. A system complex enough that it is able to pass the Turing test and achieve human level intelligence will already need to be as complex as the human brain itself. Given this complexity, it is possible that consciousness and understanding can emerge from an artificial Chinese room system.

[^logic gates]: The AND and OR basic logic gates are fairly straightforward to implement, and can be done with just two layers of artificial neurons. Adding just one hidden layer allows us to fit more complex computational models like XOR and XNOR. When we move past 4-5 layers, with each hidden layer having a sufficient amount of neurons, extremely complex logic can be modeled. This is all done simply by the stacking and chaining of simple logic (the AND, OR, NOT, etc. basic logic gates). When we backpropogate a neural network during the training phases, it would be a near impossible task to track all the possible routes through it. This is why these networks are often likened to a 'black box', because we don't actually know much of whats going on inside. Much like how we can create virtual machines, virtual communities, and virtual reality, neural networks may very well be virtual minds.

*** Virtual Minds
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: virtual-minds
  :END:
The possibility of qualia being accessible to us in terms of physical structure is not zero. Physicists had previously had no idea how magnetism and other [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_at_a_distance][action at a distance forces]] were possible. After all, how could an object exert a force on another object without touching it? The discovery of breakthroughs like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_carrier][messenger particles]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement][quantum entanglement]] solved these and enabled us to represent these previously thought to be magical forces through physical and structural means (though gravity is still somewhat a mystery). Perhaps the same could be true for qualia, perhaps there is a mediating particle for experience (an thus also thought, because thinking is the experience of consciousness, as most philosophers believe), where we can also analyze the metaphysical realm of consciousness through known theorems and laws from the chemical and physical sciences.

If this is were true, this would entail a whole world of possibilities for us. In addition to AI-related advances, if we are capable of a physical representation of consciousness, this would give us means to perhaps store streams of consciousness (AKA thoughts) for later retrieval and perhaps 'play' it back with another mind. It could potentially allow us to artificially incur thoughts on a conscious entity. This is all mere speculation and most likely not possible, certainly not currently with our technology, but it is an interesting to speculate about.

:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: anime-pop
:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :status inprogress
:END:

Some aggregated observations of common harmonic tendencies and chord progressions that give the modernistic Asian pop sound found in a lot of contemporary music from the East Asia region, in particular focusing on anime and film music. Some good examples of this type of sound include the music of film composers like Hayao Miyazaki, Joe Hisaishi, and Ryuichi Sakamoto, almost every anime opening or ending, some J-pop and C-pop artists, in particular mandopop artists like Jay Chou, Mayday, JJ Lin, contemporary Asian instrumental music (Yiruma in particular), and Western artists that also use this sound (Porter Robinson, even contemporary or neoclassical artists like Ludovico Einaudi and Maurice Ravel in certain sections of their music).

{{{note(These are based on my observations only. I am not a musical historian nor a music expert\, and I only play music as a side hobby.)}}}

*** Western Pop Origins
Since East Asian pop is descended from Western pop music, it makes sense to first take a look into the influential progressions that shaped Western pop. Namely, the following types of chord changes and their variants:

- Main harmonic progression :: Some mix of I, vi, IV, and V, notable examples include:
  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%E2%80%93V%E2%80%93vi%E2%80%93IV_progression][I-V-vi-IV]]
  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%2750s_progression][I-vi-IV-V]]
- Main cadences/resolutions/"special" chords :: The classic resolutions that are most common are obviously IV-V-I and ii-V-I. Other fairly common ones include:
  - The V-vi deceptive cadence. When combined with the subdominant, it becomes IV-V-vi (or what appears to be more common, the descending version vi-V-IV), and vi-V-IV
    - An interesting, recessed alternative from classical music is what I like to call the "plagal deceptive cadence" (IV-vi). From what I see, it typically pops up in the middle of progressions, but it can be used as a cadence.
  - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixolydian_mode][Mixolydian progressions]], basically progressions containing some form of a ♭VII. From my understanding, this came from jazz and the concept of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borrowed_chord][borrowed chords]]. The use of a occasional ♭VII with the main I, vi, IV, and V chords gives a distinctly "modern pop" sound and is very common. See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%99%ADVII%E2%80%93V7_cadence][♭VII–V7]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_progression][backdoor progressions]] for examples.
  - Progessions around the circle of fifths/fourths (I-IV-vii^{o}-iii-vi-ii-V-I), or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachelbel%27s_Canon][similar variants]]. Commonly used in the middle of progressions for smooth modulations between keys.

*** Asian Pop Chords. Why IV-V-iii-vi works
It seems a trend for Asian style pop to either start on a subdominant chord (IV), or to have it at least on a strong beat. In my view, the reason the IV is an acceptable starting chord and why it's used over other chords is because IV contains the major tonic note, as well as tonic note of the relative minor, hinting at both of these. Because the first chord usually establishes the general feel and reference point for the rest of the chords, it makes sense to choose IV over chords like V for this purpose.
**** IV-V-vi and a few (of many) variants
The IV-V-vi is a very common chord progression in not just pop music, and is just a deceptive cadence (V-vi) with a subdominant IV to set it up. The reason it works, especially for pop, is that it's easy to voice lead the bass (which is a large part of what makes or breaks a progression). Here are a few of the more popular variants:

- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IV%E2%96%B37%E2%80%93V7%E2%80%93iii7%E2%80%93vi_progression][IV-V-iii-vi]]. The "royal road progression". AKA the progression that's used in pretty much every anime opening. This is pretty much the same thing as a IV-V-vi, but since 4/4 music is often in four bar phrases, having four chords means we don't need to repeat one of chords. iii is the same thing as a V/vi (without a raised leading tone) and resolves nicely to the vi.
  - IV-V-III^{#3}-vi. You may have deduced that if iii is the same as V/vi (the dominant chord of the relative minor), we can raise the seventh making it a III^{#3}. This creates a more atonalic sound because we have more or less migrated to the minor key. The III^{#3} is often used in transitions between section changes, and is so common that I might even venture to call it the new norm.
- IV-V-vi-I.
- IV-V-I-vi.
- IV-I-V-vi. Same progression as the famous [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%E2%80%93V%E2%80%93vi%E2%80%93IV%5Fprogression][I-V-vi-IV]] that we mentioned above for Western music, only rotated so that the starting chord is on the IV.

*** Use of iii
We have already talked about the IV-V-iii-vi progression, which has a iii that assumes the role of V/vi. The iii chord can also be used to lead into the IV, being only one semitone away, which (again), works because of the voice leading in the bass. Some chord changes in pop music break the rules of functional harmony, however, it will sound fine as long as the voice leading in the bass and melody is smooth.

Some examples of progressions with iii leading to IV:
- IV-V-vi-iii
- I-iii-IV-V. Examples: Hitorigoto

Numerous studies have been conducted on spaced repetition (and on memory in general), and there is strong evidence suggesting that spaced repetition decreases the number of needed repetitions, and improves retention significantly over the long term. This article attempts to divulge into the specifics of spaced repetition implementations and the existing algorithms implemented in popular software like Anki, SuperMemo, Duolingo, and Quizlet.

Broadly speaking, there are two types of memory: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explicit_memory][declarative]] (conscious) and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_memory][non-declarative]] (unconscious). Compared to declarative memory, non-declarative memory is slow. However, the distinction our minds make between these two are fairly hazy, and we need to be wary of relying purely on our non-declarative memory, meaning that in addition to the timing, the way [[https://super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm][the information is presented is also vitally important]]. The ideal goal of studying knowledge for an exam, language learning, or similar venture is to get it into your long term memory for later retrieval. Your short term memory can only recall around 7±2 items for only about a minute after you see them[fn:1], which isn't very useful for anything other than real time processing, or recalling something temporary.

*** A Quantitative Representation of Memory
  :PROPERTIES:

Ebbinghaus (from self experiments) proposed an equation for the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve][forgetting curve]]:

{{{dtex(b =\frac{100k}{(\log(t))^c+k})}}}

Where {{{tex(b)}}} is the percentage of time saved on relearning (same thing as recall probability), {{{tex(t)}}} is the time in minutes, and {{{tex(c)}}} and {{{tex(k)}}} are constants. There are [[https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Error_of_Ebbinghaus_forgetting_curve][various reasons]] to discredit this specific equation, which I will not go into detail on. A quick summary: Ebbinghaus used nonsense syllables to test himself, which had little real world associations and coherence with past memories, and also measured with a comparatively short time interval of around 2 weeks, while spaced repetition is typically implemented well beyond that time period.

Thus, Ebbinghaus's equation is usually dismissed in favour of one of exponential decay:

{{{dtex(R(t) = e^{\frac{-t}{S}})}}}

Where {{{tex(R(t))}}} is the recall probability as a function of {{{tex(t)}}} (time), and {{{tex(S)}}} is the memory stability. The memory stability corresponds to how strong the memory is, specifically how much time it takes for the recall probability to decay to {{{tex(e^{-1})}}}. This is because when {{{tex(t = S)}}}, then {{{tex(R(t) = e^{-1})}}}.

This equation seems to make logical sense. Consider the following cases:

1. When {{{tex(t=0)}}}, {{{tex(R(0) = e^0 = 1)}}}. This makes sense because {{{tex(t=0)}}} represents the initial retention rate when the item has just been reviewed, which should be 100%.
2. When {{{tex(t >> S)}}} (meaning we have reviewed the item a very long time ago): {{{tex(R(t) \approx e^{-\infty} \approx 0)}}} (we have a retention rate of close to 0%).
3. Another idea to consider is that {{{tex(S)}}} is not constant between repetitions of the same item. Each time the item is reviewed, {{{tex(S)}}} should grow because the item becomes more familiar with each repetition. Moreover, it would make sense for {{{tex(S)}}} to increase at an exponential rate because learning should compound over time[fn:: Learning compounds over time, or at least should, in theory. This is because at the beginning stages of learning something unfamiliar, an individual has no pre-existing [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_(psychology)][schema]] of the concept. As they spend time with the material, they will develop some sort of a schema for the concept, which will help them better understand related concepts in the future.]. In other words, as we do more and more repetitions, {{{tex(S \to \infty)}}}, and when {{{tex(S >> t)}}}, then {{{tex(R(t) \approx e^{0} \approx 1)}}}. This hypothetically means that after infinite repetitions, our recall probability will be 100%.

Looking at the equation, this means that in order to accurately predict the recall probability, the main hurdle is finding an accurate value for {{{tex(S)}}}. The only other relevant variable is time {{{tex(t)}}}, which is easy to measure.

The value of {{{tex(S)}}} (memory strength) is hard to predict and is influenced by a multitude of factors. Here are some I can think of from the top of my head, ranked from easiest to hardest to measure (from the algorithm's perspective):

- Past reviews and performance on the same item, if the item was seen previously
- Difficulty of the material (subjective to individual differences)
- Format. How the material is presented.
- Previous experience and associations. More experience with similar material in the past will make future review easier. Also the degree of initial learning ([[https://faculty.washington.edu/gloftus/Downloads/LoftusForgettingCurves.pdf][Loftus, 1985]])
- The current psychological and physical state of the user. Things like emotional disposition ([[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022440502001085][Gumora & Arsenio, 2002]][fn:2]) or consumption of caffiene ([[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11325-014-0976-y][Cole, 2014]][fn:3]). Sleep ([[https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13104-015-1712-9][Mirghani et al, 2015]]) especially seems to have large effects on memory strength. Motivation is obviously also a large factor.

Reference: [[https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/english/ol/sm2][SM2]] (P. A.Wozniak, 1998)

SM2 is probably the most popular implementation of spaced repetition (and certainly the most decorated, despite it's simplicity). In the algorithm, each review item is associated with an ease factor, which we hope to correspond to the difficulty of the review item. The original implementation consists of two initial hard coded learning phase steps: 1 day, and 6 days. Variants have other initial steps, and software like Anki allow customization of these.

A fairly simple formula is used to calculate subsequent intervals:

#+begin_example
  New interval = Previous interval * Ease factor
#+end_example

The ease factor is simply a floating point number between 1.3 and 2.5. It's role, as seen in the formula, is to act as an interval multiplier leading to a larger and larger interval each time. The restrictions of 1.3 through 2.5 attempt to keep the number of repetitions reasonable. An ease below 1.3 will lead to the material being studied too often (usually indicative not because the knowledge itself is too difficult, but because it is poorly formatted or presented), and anything greater than 2.5 will space the intervals too much, especially as they get larger.

At larger intervals, even 2.5 may be too much, and this will infinitely grow. This is why most software also provide a top interval cap. Capping at around 10 months to a year sounds like a reasonable interval. Once a review item hits the cap, each review would presumably increase memory utility by a relatively large amount because the time interval is so big, and with hardly any extra time investment.

The ease factor is adaptive and changes 

Wanikani uses an alternate version of SM2 with predetermined ease factors and with intervals represented by levelling up of stages. This sounds like a less flexible version of 
**** Regression based on Recall Probability
   :PROPERTIES:

Used by: [[https://medium.com/tech-quizlet/spaced-repetition-for-all-cognitive-science-meets-big-data-in-a-procrastinating-world-59e4d2c8ede1][Quizlet]][fn:4], [[https://aclanthology.org/P16-1174.pdf][Duolingo]]

The first thought I had when pondering on algorithms for spaced repetition is using a simple logistic regression classifier (trained on the user's previous data) to output a probability that the user will get the review item right given an input of the time interval. We can use this recall probability in numerous ways, Quizlet uses it to order the items for review (items with lower recall probability are reviewed first).

My thoughts were that the user could choose a desired recall probability (we'll call this the 'recall threshold' for now), which corresponds to the decision threshold of the classifier. A recall threshold of around 80% makes sense (of course, this will vary with different individuals). The algorithm will show the item once the recall threshold for it falls below 80%. In order to accurately predict the recall probability, this classifier would be trained on features based on past couple repetitions of the same item (Quizlet uses the past 3). It would check to see if the prior attempts were correct, how quickly they were answered, and how many consecutive attempts were correct, which will all help predict the classifier predict the probability of answering the current attempt correctly. Of course, the difficulty of the material is a large factor (that Quizlet apparently doesn't use), but difficulty is different for different individuals, which is why other algorithms like the SuperMemo family ask the user to rate how easy the item was to answer and uses that rating when considering further intervals. This does require more cognitive load from the user, which can be ameliorated at the cost of accuracy by having the algorithm automatically assign the rating based on factors like the time taken to answer, or at least provide a suggested score based on such factors.

Duolingo models its 'half-life regression' approach very similar to the forgetting curve equation described above:

{{{dtex(p=2^{-\Delta / h})}}}

- {{{tex(p)}}} is the probability of recall
- {{{tex(\Delta)}}} is the time since the item was last reviewed
- {{{tex(h)}}} is the /half life/ corresponding to the learner's memory strength. The value of this is hoped to correspond with the amount of time it takes the recall probability to decay to 0.5, or 50%. This is because when {{{tex(\Delta = h)}}}, the equation evaluates to {{{tex(p = 2^{-1} = 0.5)}}}. {{{tex(h)}}} should increase exponentially with every repetition (this is analogous to the {{{tex(S)}}} memory strength value), and thus can be modeled by in the form {{{tex(b^n)}}}. Duolingo assumes 2 as the base: {{{dtex(h_{\theta} = 2^{\theta \cdot x})}}}

{{{tex(\theta)}}} is a vector of parameters and {{{tex(x)}}} is a vector of features. This is now a typical regression problem. All we need is a dataset from previous review performance consisting of the recall rate {{{tex(p)}}}, the time since last review {{{tex(\Delta)}}}, and the values for each of the feature vector {{{tex(x)}}}. Duolingo used the following features: the total number of times the user has seen the item before, the number of times the item was answered correctly and incorrectly, and a large set of lexeme tags indicating the difficulty of each item. The predicted recall rate can be calculated by using {{{tex(p = 2^{-\Delta / h_{\theta}})}}}, and loss function can be constructed by comparing the predicted value with the actual measured recall rate from our dataset. We can then find values of {{{tex(\theta)}}} that minimize this loss function. I won't go into detail about all of this, check the Duolingo paper linked above for the full equations, apparently they also decided to use factor an approximation of {{{tex(h)}}} in the cost function. It seemed to provide decent results, the following image shows an attempt for the algorithm to fit curves for the predicted recall rate based on the forgetting curve from data points (the black 'x' marks):

[fn:1] [[https://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Miller/][A well-known paper]] by psychologist George A. Miller argued that the approximate compacity of our working memory is only about 7 items. This is why memory techniques involving extending short term memory compacity aim to reduce the number of items (eg: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)][chunking]]) which is required to be held.

[fn:4] Quizlet doesn't implement true spaced repetition because it's designed for cramming. It doesn't have a strict scheduler and focuses primarily on the order of review, with higher priority items (ones with lower recall probability) being shown first. Quizlet does have a 'Long-Term Learning' mode with a scheduler that appears to follow a fixed formula of =new interval = (old interval * 2) + 1= with new items starting at a 1 day interval. Items answered incorrectly are reset to the same status as new items. Of course, this is less than optimal as the fixed rate multiplier assumes that all material is the same difficulty.

*** Me
I typically go by the name ~rayes~ online. It's not my actual name, just a pseudonym. I'm an 18-year-old FOSS supporter, Linux enthusiast, musician, and writer. I am fascinated particularly by the brain, memory, neurobiology, and psychology.

**** Hobbies
I have a fair amount of hobbies that I try to consistently do. They are fairly niche and a lot of them are uncommon, but I enjoy spending time on them, otherwise I would have dropped them already.

***** Music
I like to play and make music. I was classically trained as a pianist when I was in junior high. However, I consider myself self-taught as I feel I improved dramatically more as a result of my own practice compared to studying with a teacher. Age and maturity was probably a large factor for this, as well as the fact that when I had a teacher, I was too young to really appreciate music.

I have experience teaching students (mostly elementary aged children) piano and theory. I have taught students up to RCM level 8.

I create electronic music (mainly lofi hip hop) occasionally for fun, and to test out Linux capabilities in the professional audio scene. You may have seen me active in [[https://youtube.com/unfa000][unfa's]] Discord server, or seen my tracks featured on the [[https://www.zrythm.org/][Zrythm]] website.

***** Badminton
I play competitive badminton for fun and exercise. I have a fair amount of coaching experience with elementary and junior high aged children.

I also do other forms of exercise regularly. These include road biking (I try to do at least 45 km/week, a very measly amount compared to what some others do), rollerblading, and more recently, skateboarding (still trying to get better, I can currently only ollie and do some other basic tricks).

***** Writing
Nowadays, noone really cares about text based blogging anymore. Nonetheless, I sometimes like to write on this blog. The content on this site is composed of thoughts and research on the broad array of niche topics I'm interested in. In particular, psychology, neuroscience, statistics, machine learning, biotech, sound design, and anime/manga, or some weird combination of these. Not for profit, self-promotion, I don't even really care how many readers I get. It's mainly a dump for my thoughts and ideas that would otherwise just be wasted sitting in my head.

In the past, I've tried writing fiction in the form of a webnovel titled [[/anemoia][anemoia]], which I eventually stopped updating because there aren't enough hours in a day. It was an enjoyable experience though, and I would love to pick it up again sometime in the future. Note that I haven't really edited it and only did the first couple chapters on a whim, and I consider it a /very/ rough draft.

My writings should probably be taken with a grain of salt. They are sometimes heavily opinionated, and though I do read a fairly large number of papers, articles, and books (or at least, I like to think I do), I do not have a PhD in any of the fields I write about, and I am for the most part, self-taught.

***** Coding and Linux
I occasionally code as a hobby. I only started recently, and haven't taken it very seriously, I just do it for fun. I am particularly interested in data processing, ML and AI, and UI development. I've taken a couple MOOC courses and read some textbooks related to these. I write a fair number of scripts on a near daily basis for when I want to automate pretty much any arduous task like renaming files, scraping websites, etc. I'm also a passionate Linux fan and am fairly active in the [[https://reddit.com/r/unixporn][unixporn]] community.

Languages/skills I am proficient with:
- Rust
- Python
- Bash and POSIX shell script
- Front-end web development: HTML5, CSS, JS
- Scientific computing: R, GNU Octave/Matlab, GNUPlot
- All major operating systems, especially Redhat-based Linux distributions

***** Media
I like Japanese anime and manga, as well as their Chinese and Korean equivalents. I prefer to read over watch, so I yearn towards manga and light novels more than anime. I am reasonably fluent in Chinese because I speak it with my parents (though not at the level of a native speaker yet), and am currently learning Japanese. I hope to move on the Korean when I am more versed in these two.

I don't game very often, in fact hardly at all nowadays. Games never piqued my interest very heavily. I occasionally read visual novels sometimes, if you want to count them as games.

I also read a fair share of English literature. Some of my favourites include Atwood's /The Handmaid's Tale/ and Saint-Exupery's /The Little Prince/.

I have a [[/media][regularly updated list]] of thoughts and reviews on books, manga, and anime I have finished.

Gardening is a massive stress-relieving pastime, though it takes a large amount of dedication and effort if you want to do it well. My parents own a greenhouse (which my dad and I built), as well as some outdoor plants which i take care of. Sometimes it feels like a waste of energy, but I suppose there are much worse ways I could be using my time. And of course, the subsequent payoff of beautiful plants and organic food is worth the effort.
**** Things I use
- Pen and paper:
  - Fountain pens :: Lamy Safari for day to day use, a Pilot Metropolitan when I'm feeling fancy. I use EF sized nibs because my writing is tiny. For ink, I use a bottle of Sheaffer plain black ink. Nothing fancy.
  - Journals :: I use classic Leuchtturm 1917 A5 notebooks with blank pages. I journal according to my mood. Sometimes it's bullet journaling, sometimes it's long form, sometimes it's poetry. I don't sketch or draw though, I've tried to get into it numerous times before but always ended up dropping it after a while.

  - Terminal and shell commands :: Emacs ~shell-command~ and ~async-shell-command~ probably covers ~80% of shell commands I need to run. If I need an interactive shell, I will run either eshell or [[https://github.com/riscy/shx-for-emacs][shx-mode]]. If in the very rare case that I need full fledged terminal capabilities, I use [[https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm][emacs-libvterm]], and in an even rarer case where my Emacs daemon has crashed, I switch to another tty and restart it.
  - Browser :: Tor Browser with JS and cookies blocked for casual browsing, Ungoogled-chromium for school and professional related browsing
  - PDF's :: Emacs [[https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools][pdf-tools]]
  - Books and manga (epubs, mobis, djvu, cbz, etc.) :: I transfer them to my Kindle PW and read them there with [[https://github.com/koreader/koreader][KOReader]]
  - Video player (mostly anime and occasionally youtube) :: mpv
  - Other frequently used applications :: Anki (flashcards), Calibre (ebook library)

*** This Site
This site used to use a moderately flashy [[https://github.com/rayes0/hugo-theme-sayo][old theme]] I forked, and was filled with a couple short, opinionated, and conspicuously amateur posts. Eventually, I got bored of posting and the blog fell stagnant for a while. One day, I felt motivated enough to revamp the theme to what you are seeing now, and also decided to revamp my writings (not much has changed though, I still consider my posts amateur).

The content on this site will vary from post to post. Unless otherwise noted, all content is licensed under [[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/][Creative Commons Attribution 4.0]]. You can look at the [[/categories/][categories page]] for the main subject areas. There's also a [[/tags][tags page]] that contains smaller subtopics. For each post, I will sort it into one category that represents the primary focus topic, and add an assortment of tags for other subjects referenced. I will also almost always modify posts after I initially publish them, sometimes small edits like adding a piece of support or referencing a cool source I find, or sometimes adding whole paragraphs or refactoring the post entirely. I consider all my posts works in progress, and will work to make them better over the long term. I got this idea from the way [[https://www.gwern.net/About#long-content][Gwern]] manages his essays.

The posts of the site are written in Emacs and compiled from [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] \to Markdown using [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]], then from Markdown \to HTML using [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]]. You may question why I don't just write in Markdown and build the site with Hugo directly in one step, compared to generating Goldmark markdown first from Org mode, which seemingly adds an unnecessary layer. The reason is because Org mode has an incredibly vast and diverse feature set which is unparalleled compared to just writing in Markdown. Skim the [[https://orgmode.org/manual/][Table of Contents of the Org manual]] to get a general idea of the extensive possibilities. You will only really understand if you use Org mode for yourself, so I encourage you to try it if you haven't.

You might also ask why I don't just generate HTML directly from Org mode markup. There are many static site generators that can do this, and also Org has its own built in HTML export. However, I've yet to come across a static site generator with as powerful a templating system as Hugo. I know some find Hugo's templating drives them crazy, but I like it. Hugo even has very rudimentary support for Org files, though it is currently too limited to be properly used.

The design of this site is based on a variety of sources. CSS libraries like [[https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css][Tufte CSS]] and [[https://github.com/vincentdoerig/latex-css][LaTeX.css]] played a large role. Many elements (not only related to the design), were taken from the aforementioned [[https://www.gwern.net/][gwern.net]]. The theme is written in HTML and SCSS only (no JS). This is mainly because this site is primarily text-based and I didn't want to focus too much on the theme. Plus a lot of privacy centric users have JS disabled most of the time anyway. The font used is [[https://github.com/edwardtufte/et-book][ET-Book]], a very nice bembo-style font used by the famous Edward Tufte. If your browser doesn't allow remote fonts, it will fall back to other common serif fonts before using your system generic one.

{{<tex "\LaTeX" >}} rendering is done differently depending on whether JS is enabled or not. If JS is enabled, rendering is done (locally) with {{<tex "\KaTeX" >}}, otherwise it will fall back to static SVG images from [[https://latex.codecogs.com/eqneditor/editor.php][CodeCogs]], which isn't ideal because it creates extra external requests (a LOT of them), is much slower, and we lose responsiveness and the like, but it's better than just showing the unrendered raw LaTeX. Unfortunately, this comes with the drawback that it may duplicate every math formula on RSS readers and the like that have their own LaTeX rendering engines, and probably even more unfortunate, there seems to be no good way to solve all these problems simultaneously.

Some possible features I would like to implement in the future, while still being usable without JS:

- Sidenotes instead of footnotes would make references and extra content easy to view. Maybe something like [[https://danilafe.com/blog/sidenotes/][this]].
- Extended rendering capabilities, optionally with JS. Eg: music notation, graphs, etc. This will be determined largely by what I feel like writing in the future

**** Post Metadata
- An explanation of the metadata at the top of each post:
  - 1st field :: Main category of the page.
  - Created :: Date the page was created.
  - Modified :: The last modified date. This is done by looking at either the Git revision log or the Hugo front matter in the file itself.
  - Status :: The status of the post indicating how complete I feel it currently is. The following keywords are used:
    - 'inprogress' - An incomplete post that is still being actively added to.
    - 'draft' - A post that has most large sections and ideas laid out, but I am still working on some details.
    - 'completed' - A post I am mostly done with. There may be a few small changes like grammer and wording and such, but I most likely won't add any large details.
  - 2nd line :: List of tags. This is a list of topics which are referenced by the post, or which the post loosely falls into.
