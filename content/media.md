### The Handmaid's Tale, Margaret Atwood {#the-handmaid-s-tale-margaret-atwood}

<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">08/04/21</span></span>

> There is more than one kind of freedom," said Aunt Lydia. "Freedom to and freedom from. In the days of anarchy, it was freedom to. Now you are being given freedom from. Don't underrate it."
>
> The Handmaid's Tale (Margaret Atwood)

A very multifaceted novel full of symbolism and allusions that managed to somehow confuse, entertain, amaze me all at the same time. Though I had previously heard of Margaret Atwood, it was my first time reading her writing. In this novel in particular, witty wording, puns, symbolism, dialogue only surrounded by quotation marks under very specific circumstances, and Offred's repeated references to the future readers of the story makes it feel almost like metafictional poetry. The episodic flip flops between Offred's life with Luke, life under control by Aunt Lydia, and present life make the story hard to follow at first, especially given that there is no visual or tonal distinction between these. This is obviously a purposeful choice though, and in my opinion it's really well done. Care is taken to introduce the republic of Gilead and the background of the story sufficiently, without overexplaining or resorting to info-dumps.

The republic of Gilead in the novel justifies it's actions with a Biblical story from Genesis. Rachel, who is infertile, gives her servant Bilhah to Jacob to bear children for her. This is viewed as a positive light by proponents of the regime. However, we see that it later causes problems in the Biblical story, such as Leah doing the same thing with her servant Zilpah out of jealousy sake, and also Reuben (Jacob's firstborn son) eventually committing adultery with Bilhah, thus losing his firstborn rights to a double inheritance. I presume that Reuben in the Biblical story is analogous to Nick in _The Handmaid's Tale_, and also that the hanging of the three women during the salvaging chapter, a wive and two women on either side, is analogous to the crucifixion of Jesus.

The dystopia aspect of the novel is comparable to the one in Orwell's _1984_. In terms of plausibility, I find the situation in Orwell's novel to be more imaginable (though many would disagree). You could say the surveillance aspect [is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five%5FEyes) [already](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global%5Fsurveillance%5Fdisclosures%5F(2013%E2%80%93present)) [happening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward%5FSnowden) (or at least starting to happen). As for the manipulation of thought, that can, and already has, been done through changing the education systems, propaganda, use of terror, and other dictatorial techniques (I'm sure you can think of historical examples). Once you take these into account, it's really not too absurd to envision a _1984_-like society in the future, especially if large amounts of power happen to reside within an elite few who happen to make use of these techniques. Compared to the Gilead in _The Handmaid's Tale_, which started from a suppression of the feminist movement and a coup d'etat transforming the liberal United States into a dictatorship, the chances of a radical group like the "Sons of Jacob" in the novel succeeding and lasting are, at least in my view, less likely.

This is not to say it isn't possible, it certainly is with a large amount of following and luck (quoting from Margaret Atwood's forward to the book: "Anything could happen anywhere, given the circumstances"). Nor is it to say that Atwood's story doesn't have relevance in the political scenery, or that we shouldn't consider the imminent possibility of [similar situations](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12280617/). Perhaps we could treat as 'A Modest Proposal' (Swift) but for feminism. Or as a statement against religious theocracies in general.


## Light Novels {#light-novels}


### Toradora, 	Yuyuko Takemiya {#toradora-yuyuko-takemiya}

<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">09/15/21</span></span>

> Understanding each other was something like a miracle. For two people to understand each other, and to love each other, was like an unbelievable miracle. All the couples in the world, the friends, the spouses, the children and parents, the siblingsâ€”they could all be thought of as miracles.
>
> (Ryuji) Vol 6, Chp 3

Comical, amusing, and heartwarming light novel series that I used as some breed of comic relief from the technical readings required for my schoolwork. I enjoyed it for the most part, though it felt a little stupid and slightly cringy at times, especially the eloping marriage towards to end. Then again, by that time I was already unconditionally hooked on the characters so the wince-worthy plot didn't matter too much to me. I probably would have still liked the series no matter what happened.

I feel this is a common theme in East Asian media, and indeed most slice of life series: Endearing, captivating, unequivocally charming characters combined with mediocre, squirmy, sometimes downright bad plot. Notable examples include shows like _K-ON!_ and _Non Non Biyori_. It doesn't take long for readers to grumble about this either. Scroll down the MAL [reviews](https://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/Toradora/reviews) and [forums](https://myanimelist.net/forum/?animeid=4224) for _Toradora!_ (or for _K-ON!_, _Non Non Biyori_, or any slice of life series) and it won't take you long at all before you find the start of many negative comments about the plot, something along the lines of "boring", "poorly handled", "idiotic", "cliche", "immature", "Taiga just bullies Ryuji the whole time", "why'd Taiga just leave without a word", "it makes no sense", etc, you get the idea.

This does make characterization much more important in series like this. After all, your characters have to be pretty damn interesting for me to spend the time reading 10 volumes, each 150+ pages, about them. _Toradora!_'s characters did this for me, which is why as much as I hated the plot, I still read it and liked it.

### The Wisdom of Crowds, James Surowiecki {#the-wisdom-of-crowds-james-surowiecki}

<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">08/01/21</span></span>

> Sometimes the messiest approach is the wisest.
>
> The Wisdom of Crowds (James Surowiecki)

The fundamental idea of this book is that in problem solving and decision making aspects, a group is smarter than the smartest person in them, given the right circumstances. This means that when wanting to make a accurate or good decision (because for some problems there are no 'accurate' answers), it is preferable to go against conventional wisdom of asking only the experts and ask the crowd instead.

A couple prerequisites for a smart crowd from the book, plus some of my own speculations:

-   Diversity. A single individual only has a niche set of skills to solve problems when compared to the skillset of an entire crowd combined (assuming the crowd is diverse enough). Paradoxically, the more experts we add, the less diverse the crowd becomes, and thus the less intelligent. If we define expertise in a field as having a certain set of skills, these niche skills will be overemphasized if we have a crowd composed of only (or too many) experts. The opposite is also true. If we have too little experts, those skills that only they have will be lost.
-   Independence. The crowd ecosystem needs to have a balance of independence and coordination. Humans are quick to [imitate those around them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information%5Fcascade), which is fine if the idea they are imitating is intelligent, but this is too often not the case (eg: stock market bubbles). We can apply methods that force individual autonomy such anonymous voting, or really any system that allows individuals to make decisions simultaneously rather than one at a time (which eliminates the possibility of prior individual's decisions affecting latter ones), though this isn't practical in every case, like in markets for instance.
-   Decentralization paired with aggregation. Another problem with the oxymoron of a purely 'independent crowd' is that many problems either require [implicit knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit%5Fknowledge) or knowledge that can be expressed but would take too much effort compared to the problem. Well coordinated decentralization solves this. There are many examples testifying to the success of decentralization across the board: ant colonies, beehives, bird flocks, peer-to-peer file transfer, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and the development of Linux. However, there are plenty of decentralized systems that have gone wrong, the book mentions traffic jams and the failure of the CIA to notice paramount clues that could have prevented the September 11 attacks, for instance. The book notes that successful decentralization is not a "work on whatever you want as long as its related to the problem" kind of scheme. View decentralization as a pool of information contributed by various individuals that could be, or could not be, useful to solve the problem. A good system needs a way to aggregate that information and pick out the ones that actually point to a solution, but without resorting to a top-down organizational structure where decision making power is centralized (because then it wouldn't be decentralization and you lose the wisdom the crowd can provide). There are a couple ways Surowiecki suggests:
    -   Active communication between individual entities, which would allow them to share private knowledge and make it collective wisdom.
    -   Dedicated systems to analyze information and incorporate it to solve problems. In Linux and other open source projects, anyone from the general public can submit source code patches, but they must be reviewed by people like Torvald's and some other high level developers before they get accepted into the next release. In the case of the CIA, Surowiecki suggests that (moral issues aside) either an internal, or better, public decision market that bets (motivated by real money rewards) on the likelihood of terrorist attacks could have been a good way to aggregate information. Of course, the downside to dedicated analysis is that it requires more work and money to implement.
-   Trust. Each individual in the collective group needs to trust that the rest will behave fairly. Otherwise, we will have a cascade of emotionally motivated irrational behaviour. The book cites the example that individuals who pay taxes presume that others are doing so as well. However, if they learn that everyone in their community is evading taxes, they are more likely to evade themselves, not because they don't believe in the importance of taxpaying, but purely because [others are not doing it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimatum%5Fgame), because they believe it's unfair. Technically though, even if you evade (assuming you don't get into legal trouble for it), you still reap the benefits, like improved communities and the like. However, nobody will benefit if everyone evades. Therefore, if the majority of other individuals are paying taxes, it is logical to evade. So then why doesn't everyone evade? The answer is because they trust that the large majority of citizens will not evade, and they also trust that those who do will be punished. This trust is important to ensure cooperation.

## Horimiya {#horimiya}

<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">08/02/21</span></span>

> I bet everyone has a side they don't show anyone else.

> (Hori) Vol. 1

I really enjoyed this manga, perhaps for it's constant visual variation, interesting romance and character development, or humour. Story-wise, the first couple volumes in particular were incredibly well structured, showing the evolving relationship between Miyamura and Hori and some snippets of flashbacks to Miyamura's middle school life and Hori's family situation, all interlaced in humorous romcom moments. Starting around volume 6, there was a stagnant phase where not much was happening, the plot wasn't advancing and neither was the character development. Personally, I think a slice of life type series need to make up for lack of action-based plot with character development. The romance development in the series in some ways feels similar to [Golden Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden%5FTime%5F(novel%5Fseries)), which I presume you would also enjoy if you liked Horimiya. The art in the series is great, the covers are very nice, and you can tell, as with many other long running manga, the artist's art improves over the course of the series.

The characters were a big reason I liked this series. Miyamura has piercings and tattoos, Hori is a cute girl that likes horror and is slightly sadistic, Yuki wears her sleeves over her hands all the time, Sengoku is so thin he wears seven shirts to pad himself up, Remi is an insect lover, Sawada is terrified of all guys but Miyamura, Iura is a ball of energy and enthusiasm, Yanagi has terrible eyes. You can imagine the humour of these characters put together, especially when the manga deals with the idea of internal and external self.

The ending of the story leaves a couple side romances unresolved: the situation with Yuki and Tooru, Sengoku's parent's opinion on him and Remi, Iura's sister and Kitahara, as well as Souta and Yuuna. Although this does leave a slightly empty feeling to the reader, I don't consider it to be too much of a problem because the main romance has already been settled, plus it gives room for some thought.

> Armin Arlert

Very hyped, action-packed, shounen series that just finished serializing. I was waiting for this series to finish before starting it. Because it was so hyped, I had high expectations coming in. Right away, I saw various similarities between it and [Yakusoku no Neverland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%5FPromised%5FNeverland), which I read last year. In fact, they are so similar I wouldn't be surprised if they were directly based on each other.

To be honest, although I didn't hate the manga, I didn't particularly enjoy it either, at least compared to similar manga like _The Promised Neverland_ and _Tokyo Ghoul_, or even compared to action-shounen manga with human-eating premises like _Demon Slayer_. I don't exactly know the reason, it wasn't like I didn't want to enjoy it (or more accurately I wanted to want to enjoy it). I think that it is overhyped for the quality that it is, but I feel insecure with saying that. After all, it's [won numerous major awards and the first volume was on the New York Times Manga Best Seller list for 81 straight weeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack%5Fon%5FTitan#Reception), so I don't want to discredit it as a 'bad series' when obviously it's status and ranking says otherwise. I think the reason I didn't like it is because I'm a sucker for slice of life series, not action series. For action series to be interesting to me, there needs to be a psychological element, which both _The Promised Neverland_ and _Tokyo Ghoul_ have. AoT is mostly focused on the "fighting/power" aspect.


## Koe no Katachi {#koe-no-katachi}

<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">10/02/21</span></span>

> There's some things you just can't change. I know that personally. I think it's the time you spend trying to change that's more important.
>
> (Ishida) Vol. 7 Ch 57

Koe no Katachi is most famous of course for it's anime adaptation directed by Naoko Yamada (which I haven't seen, I've only read the manga). At the crux, I feel it is about communication. Nishimiya is an elementary schooler who is hearing-impaired, obviously can't communicate through normal means and uses a paper and notebook instead. Though she knows sign language (or is at least learning it), this is still a barrier because most of the people in her class don't, and are unwilling to learn it.

In fact, the whole farce can be pinpointed to a series of misinterpretations of other's speech/actions. (1) The bullying started with Ishida writing on the blackboard mean words targeted towards Nishimiya in hopes of getting her angry. Ishida and his classmates erase the board for her, a pretend gesture of kindness. Nishimiya interprets this as a real gesture and wholeheartedly thanks everyone. (2) When Ishida starts openly treating her badly, everyone in the class laughs, which Ishida takes as them approving him of his actions. He tells a joke about how Nishimiya can't hear because she didn't have sutras painted on her ears, which even the teacher laughs at. (3) The teacher openly tells Ishida that he understands how he feels in their talk about Ishida destroying Nishimiya's hearing aid (which by the way, Ueno was the first to grab, not him). This was probably just his way of supporting him as a teacher, and probably also to protect his job, evident by his words "All I'm telling you is don't embarrass me.". Ishida takes this as a _confirmation_ for his actions and comes up with the conclusion that he doesn't have to apologize. (4) Right after his talk with the teacher, Ishida's friend Shimada tells him blatantly "Here's your chance" when they see Nishimiya on their way home. He almost certainly meant "here's your chance [to apologize]". Ishida took it as "here's your chance [to bully her more]".

It is when the school principle comes to talk about Nishimiya's missing hearing aids and the financial damage incurred does Ishida recognize what people thought of his actions. With Kawai saying that none of the girls in class approved of what he was doing, and Shimada saying that he told him to knock it off but he didn't listen. They then push him into the puddle after school. Ishida and Nishimiya are foils for each other. Nishimiya physically cannot hear. Ishida can hear but can't get the message. Based on the current state of circumstances, it should be clear which one is worse.

By now, hopefully you also get the other point I am trying to make: that the people around Ishida are primarily at fault for the ongoing nature of the bullying. No one actively tried to stop Ishida. If they had a problem with it, then why didn't they try to stop him? His teacher is also at fault. He should have resolved this or at least noticed and reported it at it's early stages. Instead, he waited until the damages amounted to 17 hundred thousand yen. And to make matters worse, after Ishida starts becoming the target of bullying, his teacher does absolutely nothing and tells him "I warned you didn't I, it's your responsibility". What kind of teacher tells his elementary student that?

An somewhat interesting subpoint the manga makes is the fact that maybe stereotypes are learned behaviour (related to the school of thought that individuals are [products of their environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism)). We see that the girls in the class are initially inclined to help out Nishimiya with her classwork, but eventually get tired of it, which leads them to start disliking her and passive-aggressively treating her miserably. The children have been conditioned with the idea that "deaf individuals = pain to deal with", and more generally, "disabled/abnormal individuals = not worth the time" which is perhaps an early development toward a [just-world hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-world%5Fhypothesis) bias. Maybe this is the reason that the idea of karma keeps coming back in the series ([further reading on related topic](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.37.10.1798), _cough_ scihub), and why both Nishimiya and Ishida attempt suicide.

The three somewhat infamous series _Suzuka, Fuuka_, and _Kimi no Iru Machi_ by Kouji Seo, set in the same universe. The series could be read standalone, though I read them back to back in the following order: Suzuka, Fuuka, Kimi no Iru Machi, so when "the thing" (Hint: truck.

## Chibi Vampire {#chibi-vampire}

<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">10/25/21</span></span>

A cute and light read. Elements of humour combined with originality like a vampire that gives blood instead of taking made the story refreshingly engaging. When the state of affairs between the vampires started getting serious, the story took a more action-based, serious tone, which I thought was appropriate.

Though the manga is centred around Karin and her love life, to my surprise most of my attention kept on being brought to her little sister Anju, who is without a doubt my favourite character in the series. Out of all the characters (besides Karin and the situation with being "the psyche"), she goes through the most, having been constantly monitoring her sister and taking care of nosebleeds and such for her whole life, then turning into an adult and finding out she can't spend time with her like she used to. The panels she shares when Ren is consoling her is the most impactful to me, perhaps because I am an older brother and I can relate to the homologous pain you feel when your sister is sad. The scene where she is parting with her sister for good in the ending is unequivocally the most touching in the entire manga.

Overall, an inspiriting new take on the typical vampire-romance trope.
