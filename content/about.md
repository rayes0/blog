Hi, I'm rayes. A stereotypical asian, a FOSS and privacy supporter, linux enthusiast and piano player. In my spare time, I like to play around with software, read manga, rollerblade, cycle, play badminton, and learn new things.

I am fascinated by memory, the brain, and biology in general, especially relating to neuroscience and psychology. I have in interest in math, literature, and history, and am also a long time anki flashcarder and am currently using anki to learn languages as well as some things for school.
