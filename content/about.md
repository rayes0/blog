Hello, thanks for taking interest into my blog. This page contains some information about me and this site. It's fairly long-winded for a simple about page, so read or skim it as you wish.

# Me

I typically go by the name rayes online. It's not my actual name, just a pseudonym. I'm a 17 year old FOSS supporter, linux enthusiast, musician, and writer. I am fascinated by memory, the brain, and biology, especially relating to biochemistry, neuroscience and psychology, and machine learning.

## Hobbies

I have a fair amount of hobbies, some which I consistently do, and some which I have now only do occasionally. They are fairly niche and a lot of them are uncommon, but I enjoy spending time on them (otherwise I would have dropped most of them already).

### Music

I like to play and make music. I was classically trained as a pianist, and had a teacher from junior high to the start of high school. However, I consider myself primarily self taught as I feel like I improved considerably more as a result of my own practise during high school rather than the couple years where I had a teacher. I speculate that age and maturity was probably a large factor for this, and the fact that I was too young to really appreciate music.

I have experience teaching students (younger children, mostly) piano and theory. I have taught students up to RCM level 8.

I create electronic music sometimes as well on my linux machine. You may have seen me active in [unfa's](https://youtube.com/unfa000) Discord server, or seen some of my tracks featured on the [Zrythm](https://www.zrythm.org/en/index.html) website. Linux has long been usable for audio production thanks to many open source DAW's and plugins, though of course don't expect it to be FL Studio quality. Audio on Fedora especially is very usable because of a COPR repo called [LinuxMao](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/ycollet/linuxmao/). There is also the [CCRMA repo](http://ccrma.stanford.edu/planetccrma/software/), but I recommend reading [this section](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/18/html/Musicians_Guide/sect-Musicians_Guide-Knowing_Whether_to_Use_Planet_CCRMA.html) of the Fedora docs before using it. Also note that only Fedora releases 28, 29, and 30 are officially supported (though it should still work with any later releases, and probably even most prior ones as well).

I'm mainly into the following genres:

- lofi hip hop and chillstep, mainly Chinese and Japanese inspired
- Piano (contemporary, sometimes classical or jazz if I'm up for it)

### Badminton

I play competitive badminton, for fun and exercise. I have a fair amount of coaching experience, mainly with younger elementary aged children although I have taught a few adult classes before (teaching players older than you is awkward though).

I also do other forms of exercise fairly frequently. These include road biking (I try to do at least 45km/week, a very measly amount compared to what some others do), rollerblading (which I have gotten fairly proficient in), and more recently, skateboarding (still trying to get better, I can currently only ollie and do some other basic tricks).

### Writing

Nowadays, noone cares much about text based blogging anymore. Nonetheless, I sometimes like to write on this blog. The articles/essays here are primarily factual-based and contain thoughts and research on niche topics I'm interested in (stuff like neuroscience, machine learning, psychology, biotech, sound design, and anime/manga, or some weird combination of these). Not for profit, self-promotion, I don't even really care how many readers I get. It's mainly a dump for my thoughts and ideas that would otherwise just be wasted sitting around in my head.

In the past, I've tried writing fiction in the form of a webnovel titled [anemoia](/anemoia) which I eventually stopped updating because there aren't enough hours in a day. It was an enjoyable experience though, and I would love to pick it up again sometime in the future. Because it's not updating and it was written a while ago and I haven't really edited it, it's not accessible through the main menu and the only place on this site I've linked to it is above.

My writings should probably be taken with a grain of salt. I do read a fairly large number of papers, articles, and books, but I do not have a PHD in psychology, statistics, bioinformatics, numerical computing, computer science, philosopy, english, political science, or any related field. I'm just a 17 year old high school student who happens to be interested in these.

### Coding and Linux

I occasionally code as a hobby. I only actually started coding more seriously relatively recently, so I'm certainly not the best at it. My interests are mainly focused around data processing, ML and AI, and UI development. I also write a fair number of scripts anytime I want to automate something (eg: rename files, scrape websites for quotes, etc.). I'm also a passionate linux fan and am fairly active in the [unixporn](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn) community.

- Languages/Skills I am proficient with:
  - Rust
  - Python
  - Bash and POSIX shell script
  - Front-end web development: HTML5, CSS and SCSS, JS
  - Scientific computing: GNU Octave/Matlab
  - Graphing and Data visualization: GNUPlot
  - All major operating systems, especially Redhat-based linux distributions (Fedora is my current daily driver)
  
- Languages and tools I have spent some time using or trying (min 30 hours), but I wouldn't call myself proficient:
  - C
  - Lua
  - SQLite
  - React and Vue.js
  - Numpy, Detectron2, Tensorflow (object detection API), Matplotlib
  
- Languages and frameworks I want to learn in the future: Android development (Java and Kotlin), Flutter/Dart, R, Julia, C++ (reluctant to start this one since I feel like other languages have way more potential)

I use Emacs as my main text editor, though I previously used neovim + tmux full time. I have tried fully featured IDE's in the past and although they are featureful, the psychological clutter of using them after having tasted the minimalism of vim was too much, so I settled on emacs as a compromise.

I've been daily driving linux for a fair amount of time now, and I currently use a custom install of Fedora. I have very heavily keyboard and terminal-based habits, and I am usually either in a terminal (rxvt-unicode) with tmux, or inside emacs (or sometimes a [terminal *inside* emacs](https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm) :) ). I currently use a keyboard focused, minimal, barless [herbstluftwm setup](https://github.com/rayes0/dotfiles#herbstluftwm). I would switch to Wayland if it weren't for a [certain GPU manufacturer](http://www.nvidia.com/). We can't deny that they make good GPU's though.

### Media

I like Japanese anime and manga, as well as their Chinese and Korean equivalents. I prefer reading over watching, so I yearn more towards manga and light novels than anime. I know a fair bit of Chinese and am currently learning Japanese. I hope to move on to Korean when I am more versed in these two.

I don't game very often, in fact hardly at all nowadays, games never piqued my interest very heavily. I occasionally read visual novels sometimes, if you want to count them as games.

I also read a fair share of English literature, again yearning towards books way more than movies similarly to manga over anime. Some of my favourites include Egan's *A Visit from the Goon Squad*, Orwell's *1984*, and Saint-Exupery's *The Little Prince*.

I have regularly updated lists for both my [in progress](/media/in-progress/) and [finished](/media/finished) books/manga/anime.

### Misc

#### Speedcubing

{{<figure src="/img/about/speedcubes.jpg" title="A subset of my humble speedcube collection">}}

I [speedcube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing). I used to go to competitions, but I don't compete much anymore. Speedcubing is defintely a niche hobby and does require you to spend a decent chunk of time practising and memorizing algorithms. It is definitely fun though and hitting a solve with a personal best on the timer in front of you is one of the most satisfying things ever.

#### Gardening

{{<figure src="/img/about/greenhouse.jpg" title="Inside the greenhouse">}}

{{<figure src="/img/about/greenhouse-outside.jpg" title="Outside the greenhouse">}}

Gardening is a massive stress-relieving pastime, though it takes a large amount of dedication if you want to do it well. My parents own a greenhouse (which me and my dad built), and some outdoor plants, which I take care of. Sometimes it feels like a waste of energy, but there are much worse ways I could be using my time. Of course, the eventual reward of beautiful plants and organic food pays for the effort.

# This Site

This site used to use a moderately flashy [old theme](https://github.com/rayes0/hugo-theme-sayo) I forked, and was filled with a couple short, opinionated, and conspicuously amateur posts. Eventually, I got bored of posting and the blog fell stagnant for a while. One day, I felt motivated enough to revamp the theme to what you are seeing now, and also decided to revamp my writings (not much has changed though, I still consider my posts amateur).

The content on this site will vary from post to post. Unless otherwise noted, all content is licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). You can look at the [categories page](/categories/) for the main subject areas. There's also a [tags page](/tags) that contains smaller subtopics. For each post, I will sort it into one category that represents the primary focus topic, and add an assortment of tags for other subjects referenced. I will also almost always modify posts after I initially publish them, sometimes small edits like adding a piece of support or referencing a cool source I find, or sometimes adding whole paragraphs or refactoring the post entirely. I consider all my posts works in progress, and will work to make them better over the long term. I got this idea from the way [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/About#long-content) manages his essays.

The posts of the site are compiled from markdown using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/). Some areas in the [meta](/meta/) section are directly from my personal notes folder, and thus are written in Orgmode and compiled to Hugo markdown with [ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/). I could migrate this entire blog to Orgmode, but I don't see a point in doing so unless I need specific features of Orgmode, like the statistics cookies and todo keywords in my media tracker, for instance. Markdown with Emacs is also [fairly comfy](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MarkdownMode) for writing posts, so I don't feel too much pressure to fully switch. In addition, Hugo shortcodes are a pain to use with ox-hugo and using them renders the org file more or less useless for any sort of export besides Hugo.

The design of this site is based on a variety of sources. CSS libraries like [Tufte CSS](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css) and [LaTeX.css](https://github.com/vincentdoerig/latex-css) played a large role. Many elements (not only related to the design), were taken from the aforementioned [gwern.net](https://www.gwern.net/). The theme is written in HTML and SCSS only (no JS). This is mainly because this site is primarily text-based and I didn't want to focus too much on the theme. Plus a lot of privacy centric users have JS disabled most of the time anyways. The font used is [ET-Book](https://github.com/edwardtufte/et-book), a very nice bembo-style font used by the famous Edward Tufte. If your browser doesn't allow remote fonts, it will fall back to other common serif fonts before using your system generic one.

{{<tex "\LaTeX" >}} rendering is done differently depending on whether JS is enabled or not. If JS is enabled, rendering is done (locally) with {{<tex "\KaTeX" >}}, otherwise it will fall back to static images from [CodeCogs](https://latex.codecogs.com/eqneditor/editor.php), which isn't ideal because it creates extra external requests (a LOT of them), is slower, and we lose responsiveness and the like, but it's better than just rendering the LaTeX raw.

Some possible features I would like to implement in the future, while still being usable without JS:

- Sidenotes instead of footnotes would make references and extra content easy to view. Maybe something like [this](https://danilafe.com/blog/sidenotes/).
- Extended rendering capabilities, optionally with JS. Eg: music notation, graphs, etc. This will be determined largely by what I feel like writing in the future

## Post Metadata

An explanation of the metadata at the top of each post:

- 1st field: Main category of the page.
- *Created*: Date the page was created.
- *Modified*: The last modified date. This is done by looking at either the Git revision log or the Hugo front matter in the file itself.
- *Status*: The status of the post indicating how complete I feel it currently is. The following keywords are used:
  - 'inprogress' - An incomplete post that is still being actively added to.
  - 'draft' - A post that has most large sections and ideas laid out, but I am still working on some details.
  - 'completed' - A post I am mostly done with. There may be a few small changes like grammer and wording and such, but I most likely won't add any large details.
- 2nd line: List of tags. This is a list of topics which are referenced by the post, or which the post loosely falls into.
