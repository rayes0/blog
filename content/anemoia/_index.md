**anemoia** - *n.* nostalgia for a time youâ€™ve never known. From *[The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows](https://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/post/105778238455/anemoia-n-nostalgia-for-a-time-youve-never)*.

Evan is a student at a government-run boarding school, which acts as a supposed orphanage for the kids there, who are said to have lost their parents at a young age. However, this is just a guise for the true purpose of the school, where the kids learn how to use magic to fight, and are conditioned to suppress emotions such as empathy and love, said to make them weak. The kids are used as soldiers and sent on missions, which usually involve killing individuals which the government wants dead. Evan is sent one day on a mission to kill a man who may be involved in a terrorism plot. However, as things turn out, this mission may not be as easy as Evan thought.
