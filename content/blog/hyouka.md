The *Classic Literature Club* light novel series by Honobu Yonezawa showcases Oreki Hotarou, a high school boy and zealous energy conservationist. Starting with his first day of high school, the series follows him as he experiences new situations challenging his previous life. In this post, I want to share some predictions about Hotarou and why he is how he is. I will also draw parallels between the relationship he has with the other characters, in an attempt to hopefully gain a richer understanding of each of them and a new appreciation for the series.

{{<note "This post contains spoilers up to where the anime ends! (Corresponding to novel volumes 1 to 4). I will also discuss events from the other two novels not adapted in the anime in the last couple of paragraphs of this essay/post, which I will warn with a note similar to this one. Readers who have only watched the anime and don't want to be spoiled will still be able to read the majority of this analysis." >}}

# Plot Review

For those not in the loop, the basic premise of Hyouka goes something like this: A boy by the name Oreki Hotarou is impelled to join the Classics Club of his high school by his sister, currently travelling in India. As all previous members had graduated, the club was in danger of being abolished, something his sister, a previously avid member, couldn't bear.

Now Hotarou isn't just a teen that would jovially comply with anything he is told. It turns out Hotarou adheres to a stringent doctrine: "If I don't have to do it, I won't. If I have to do it, make it quick". And he isn't exactly happy about his life getting derailed through a letter from India.

But being the good little brother he is, he eventually complies (with a little bit of fear to motivate him[^Taiho-jutsu]) and thus meets the venerable Chitanda Eru, a member seeking to join for "personal reasons". Fukabe and Mayaka, two of Oreki's friends, also eventually join the club. Together, as the four of them go about their club activities (which involve a lot of Chitanda pulling them into solving mysteries[^Chitanda]), Oreki's previous conservational lifestyle is repeatedly challenged. As the story progresses through each new arc, each time he solves a mystery, each time he does something contradicting his motto, and his evolving relationship with Chitanda, Oreki experiences first-hand how it is like to live a "rose-coloured life".

[^Chitanda]: Chitanda is a girl with unbounded curiosity. When she becomes intrigued, she is determined to solve whatever mystery she is facing, dragging the other members of the club, especially Oreki, into the situation.

[^Taiho-jutsu]: Tomoe Oreki (Hotarou's sister) is said to be specialized in a form of martial arts called [Taiho-jutsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiho_Jutsu), said by Hotarou to be "pretty painful if one has intent to hurt".

[^daughter of time]: The Japanese title for the first novel in the series is *Hyouka*, literally meaning 'ice-cream' (those who read it or watched the anime will know!). The subtitle of the novel (*You can't escape*, later changed to *The niece of time*) is a reference to the mystery novel *The Daughter of Time* by Josephine Tey, which similarily to Hyouka, deals with a historical mystery. In both novels, the detective (Alan in Tey's novel and Oreki in Hyouka) is given historical renderings containing limited information about a past event. Both detectives have dubious thoughts about the popular opinion explaining the outcome, and eventually use logic to deduce a truthful explanation.

## If I don't have to, I won't

Oreki is of course, the main character of the story. He is also the character that undergoes the largest degree of growth and transformation. The most stunning feature about Oreki is his faithfulness to his indolent motto: "If I don't have to do it, I won't. If I have to do it, make it quick". While this could be interpreted as Oreki being motivated to follow through with his identity, I personally think that Oreki is just lazy, and uses this motto as an excuse not to do anything. He doesn't actually have a reason to follow it, and doesn't even know where it came from.

We are not told much background about Oreki. We know he has an older sister who travels a lot, and as a consequence he is alone at home most of the time. He isn't very social and doesn't do things like hang out with friends, we are told that his two closest friends (Mayaka whom he has known since first grade and Satoshi from middle school) haven't ever even stepped foot into his house.
 

# Indolence: A psychological perspective

Laziness is defined by a lack of motivation. In Oreki's case, he is unmotivated to participate in club activities and other hallmarks of a rosy-coloured life. Some possible explanations for the causes of laziness specific to Oreki's case are detailed below, though the concepts will apply to lack of motivation for anybody in general:

**Psychoanalytic viewpoint - *The pleasure principle***: The [pleasure principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleasure_principle_(psychology)) could be responsible for low levels of motivation. It is the Freudian idea that we will put off doing activities that cause negative emotions like stress and anxiety, in an attempt to avoid these emotions. According to traditional psychoanalysis, this is done through the unconscious level of our mind (containing animistic desires like sexual and aggressive drive), the id in conflict with our ego, our pleasures in conflict with the [reality principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_principle)). Applying this to  Oreki would mean that an experience in his development lead to fixation in one of Freud's psychosexual stages[^freud-stages], in this case most likely the latent stage. However, I don't think that the psychosexaul stages is responsible for Oreki's behaviour. First of all, there is little actual scientific support for the theory[^freud-support], but more importantly it appears that Oreki is purposefully adhering to his motto, and fully aware that he is doing so. This is a shattering blow to the application of Freud's theories which involve the patient's unconscious thoughts, rather than their conscious ones.

**Neuroscience viewpoint - *Dopamine***: Our brains process reward through dopamine. Dopamine is given off when a reward is *anticipated* (independently of whether a reward is actually received or not[^reward]), and low dopamine is highly correlated with low motivation (note that correlation does not necessarily mean causation[^correlation]). Moreover, dopamine is one of the major factors our brains use to decide whether something is *worth the effort or not*[^effort]. Oreki deems that a large majority of seemingly normal high school activities are not worth the effort, including things like joining a club, or going for a run outside (these two are direct examples from the anime). The cause of this could be that his mind is not being given enough dopamine in these cases.

**Behaviourist viewpoint - *Conditioning***: Behavioural psychology is based around the idea that the personality of a person is a direct product of their environment, and thus we should be considered about the observable characteristics of individuals[^behavioural]. Motivation is highly associated with conditioning[^conditioning], specifically reinforcement or punishment. [Incentive theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation#Incentive_motivation) could be the reason that Oreki is not motivated to do anything. He may not see any tangible short term or long term rewards for wasting his energy. 

[^freud-support]: Freud's theories are widely disputed, especially his ideas of the Oedipus and Electra complexes (see a [footnote from another post](http://localhost:1313/blog/slow-cold-chick/#fn:2) for more info).

[^freud-stages]: Freud defined a couple psychosexaul stages that infants need to pass to become mentally healthy. He called conflicts during these stages "fixation" and proposed that fixation can lead to a mentally unhealthy adult. I have detailed each of these stages in a [footnote from another post](http://localhost:1313/blog/slow-cold-chick/#fn:7). Oreki's avoidance of energy-intensive tasks would be considered the latent stage (corresponding to around 6-12 years old) because this is where societal skills are developed, and the child's superego and ego develop enough to repress the id.

[^correlation]: Correlation does not imply causation. A causal relationship cannot be proved (it can only be inferred) from two correlated events without making logical fallacies. Consider the following cases:<br>1. When I take caffeine, I feel less tired. This means that my lack of energy is due to a lack of caffeine (Reverse causality fallacy, cause and effect are not bidirectional. Just because caffeine makes you feel less tired does not mean that the tiredness is *caused* by lack of caffeine)<br>2. Increases in sales of Christmas decorations are strongly correlated with more cases of colds. Therefore, Christmas decorations cause cold. (This example fails to take into account the possible presence of a third factor which is the cause of both the increase in sales and the cases of cold, in this case, the winter season. This is called a "spurious relationship" in mathematics).

[^reward]: This is why individuals will continue gambling even if they lose money, for example. The mere possibility of reward or success is a motivator. See reference (6) for a simulated study with rats.

[^effort]: Simplified summary of the paper: In this 2015 study, rats were given an adaptive decision-making task of either moving left or right of a port, each with seperate, variable reward possibilties of being rewarded a food pellet. They were found that when the reward rate was set higher, the rats responded faster, thus were more motivated. There's also a lot more interesting findings in the paper, and I suggest you read the full detailed version. (Hamid, A. A., Pettibone, J. R., Mabrouk, O. S., Hetrick, V. L., Schmidt, R., Vander Weele, C. M., … Berke, J. D. (2015). Mesolimbic dopamine signals the value of work. Nature Neuroscience, 19(1), 117–126. doi:10.1038/nn.4173)

[^behavioural]: This is in contrast to Freud and other psychoanalytic psychologists who look at the unconscious mental and internal psyche.

[^conditioning]: For those not versed in psychology, there are two major types of behavioural conditioning: Classical or Pavlovian conditioning, which uses a neural stimulus to create a conditioned response. Eg: Ivan Pavlov was able to get dogs to salivate on demand without food when only a bell was rung. Look at the following picture for reference:<br>
<img src='/img/hyouka/pavlov-conditioning.png' width='50%'/><br>
Operant conditioning is another type of conditioning where behaviours leading to positive outcomes will increase, and behaviours leading to negative outcomes will decrease. Basically this means that behaviours are goal driven.

# The Curse of Knowledge

>ipse se nihil scire id unum sciat (Latin for "I know that I know nothing.")
>
>(The Socratic paradox)

Oreki is a terrible judge of self-ability and attributes his deductive powers to luck. It's actually quite common among skilled individuals to underestimate themselves. The converse is also true, incompetent individuals tend to [overestimate their ability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect). The typically accepted explanation for this is that competent individuals are subject to the  infamous cognitive bias known as the 'curse of knowledge'[^curse_knowledge], and incompetent individuals often do not have the necessary skills to recognize their own errors, and thus often believe they are performing better than they actually are.

[^curse_knowledge]: When talking with less knowledgable individuals, competant individuals will oftentimes assume that other individuals are competant enough to understand them, that is, assume that others are as competent as themselves. This stems from the fact that the competent individual assumes that because they can do something easily, everyone else should also be able to. As individuals improve at a task, their perceived standards go up.

This could be something that Oreki is experiencing. Conceiving ideas from the perspective of others is excruciatingly difficult, and whether we like it or not, it influences our decisions. This egocentrism is something everyone faces to some degree, because accepting someone else's view oftentimes means neglecting our own.

Therefore, it could be that Oreki, adept at solving mysteries, is simply too indifferent as to why the people around him cannot do the same things he is doing. He considers himself ordinary, and thinks that if he can do it, everyone else should at least be able to match him, especially Chitanda, with an astounding memory, top scores at Kamiyama high school, and part of a wealthy family. Ironically, Chitanda thinks the exact same about her grades. She remarks that anyone is capable of doing what she is doing, given that they have all the pieces, but she wants to look at the "big picture" (more on this later). Note that the curse of knowledge is an unconscious cognitive bias, meaning Oreki himself may not be aware that he is thinking this way, and thus without others pushing him (Chitanda) he will take no prevalent actions himself to correct it.

In many ways, egocentrism and the curse of knowledge are forms of pride, though not in the traditional sense where one has exceedingly high regard of oneself. As stated above, accepting other's views means neglecting effort and energy focusing on our own, and potentially requires amendment on our part or in some cases finding out that you are flat out wrong. Pride is referred to in the series when the characters talk about it as one of the seven deadly things. Chitanda notes that the sins are not necessarily bad, and having a balance of them is important. For example she thinks that if you have no pride, then it follows that you would have no self-confidence either. Personally, I do not think that Oreki is victim to pride. He clearly shows he is capable of looking at things from another's perspective, not only to solve mysteries through reasoning through the culprit's motives, but in his everyday life with the other club members as well (such as through the Valentine chocolate mystery).
