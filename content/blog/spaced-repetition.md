Spaced repetition is an [evidence-based learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_learning) technique which utilizes the [spacing effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect). In contrast to more traditional repetition-based learning strategies such as cramming in which the main focus is on the total number of repetitions, spaced repetition is timing-based and focuses on maximizing efficiency by doing repetitions at scheduled times (typically decided by the difficulty of the material). Numerous studies have been conducted on spaced repetition (and on memory in general), and there is strong evidence suggesting that spaced repetition decreases the number of needed repetitions, and improves retention significantly over the long term. In this article, I will explore how memory works, and what makes spaced repetition so effective by looking some major studies done on the topic. I will also share some general ideas and observations from the point of view of a daily user of spaced repetition.

# Memory - How do we encode information?

Psychologists describe memory as an information processing system consisting of three stages:

1. Encoding
2. Storage
3. Retrieval/Recall
