Spaced repetition is an [evidence-based learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_learning) technique which utilizes the [spacing effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect). In contrast to more traditional repetition-based learning strategies such as cramming in which the main focus is on the total number of repetitions, spaced repetition is timing-based and focuses on maximizing efficiency by doing repetitions at scheduled times (typically decided by the difficulty of the material). Numerous studies have been conducted on spaced repetition (and on memory in general), and there is strong evidence suggesting that spaced repetition decreases the number of needed repetitions, and improves retention significantly over the long term. In this article, I will explore how memory works, and what makes spaced repetition so effective by looking some major studies done on the topic. I will also share some general ideas and observations from the point of view of a daily user of spaced repetition.

# Memory and the Spacing Effect

**memory** - *n.* &nbsp; the power or process of reproducing or recalling what has been learned and retained especially through associative mechanisms (from Merraim Webster)

Psychologists define two broad types of memory: [declarative]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explicit_memory) (conscious) and [non-declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_memory) (unconscious). Compared to declarative memory, non-declarative memory is slow. However, as we will talk about later, the distinction our minds make between these two are fairly hazy, and we need to be wary of relying purely on our non-declarative memory.

The ideal goal of studying information is to get it into your long term memory for later retrieval (your short term memory can only recall around 7Â±2 items for only about a minute after you see them[^1]). Generally, our declarative memory follows a thoroughly-studied, three step process:

[^1]: [A well-known study](https://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Miller/) by psychologist George A. Miller showed that the approximate compacity of our working memory is only about 7 items. This is why memory techniques involving extending short term memory compacity aim to reduce the number of items (eg: [chunking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology))) which is required to be held.

1. Encoding: This is the process by which information is processed and absorbed.
2. Storage: Our memories are encoded through association. This is extremely important because the more associations we are able to produce, the stronger the memory will be.
3. Retrieval/Recall
