Multifarious collection of symbolism, leitmotifs, and other thematic and non-verbal design choices I noticed in the movie _Liz to Aoi Tori_ while watching through it. If I were to describe this show, I would say it has the dewy, light but slow pacing of Shinkai's _The Garden of Words_ with the character design and general air similar to that of _A Silent Voice_ (which is understandable given the sizable proportion of staff shared between _A Silent Voice_ and this movie), slapped with a unsaturated, watercolour-like palette. With animation being a medium that forces everything to be deliberately chosen (the background, colours, lighting, etc.) there is a large degree of possibility with regard to non-verbal communication. The direction Yamada said that everything in this movie was purposefully chosen, and there are almost no accidents.


## Sound alignment {#sound-alignment}

Throughout many scenes in the movie, the steps of the girls are accompanied by a satisfying tap sound (which Yamada the director said was sampled from actual real life sounds). These steps are aligned to the BPM of the underlying track. If you know anything about animation, you probably already understand how hard this is. Following a rigid structure while keeping the characters movements still feeling natural is not a trivial task, and I imagine painstaking work went into crafting this element of the film.


## Red: String, Watches, and Berries {#red-string-watches-and-berries}

The string Nozomi uses for her oboe reeds immediately catches your eye. In a film with largely cool blue, unsaturated hues, a sudden poppy colour like deep red is hard to miss. The film cuts to this string many times across multiple scenes. It's as if Yamada is yelling to the viewer: This is important! Explicit care is even taken to show Mizore tensing her grip over the string spool when Yuuko asks whether she is applying to music school only because of Nozomi:

|                                                                                          |                                                                                          |

And again, when Reina confronts her about being "incompatible" with Nozomi when playing the solo:

This string is analogous to the berries in the story of Liz


## Blowfish {#blowfish}

The blowfish are a fairly obvious symbol in the movie. There can be numerous interpretations of what it represents. Lots may say that Nozomi is the blowfish, because she was nice to Mizore at first and convinced her to join the band, but then abandoned her by quitting later (this happens before the movie). Thus she is like a blowfish that looks cute but is lethally poisonous. This makes sense and there is nothing wrong with analyzing it this way.

However, based on looking at a couple scenes of the movie, I very much believe Yamada was trying to portray the opposite as well. Nozomi is jealous that their teachers only talks to Mizore, which is made obvious by the

If you think about their past, this makes sense. Nozomi always believed she had to upper hand, she is the one who first approached her, who first


## Nozomi's Cage {#nozomi-s-cage}

{{< figure src="/img/liz-to-aoi-tori/cage.png" link="/img/liz-to-aoi-tori/cage.png" >}}

The surrounding trees in the above shot outline a cage, which Nozomi is depicted as trapped in. She is sitting looking out at the open sky (the background composition incidentally is a nice use of the rule of thirds), representative of her longing for freedom by alluding to the blue bird extended imagery. The heavy use of saturation and greenery is very uncharacteristic of the school most of the film is set in. This is likely to allude to the vibrant garden from the fairy tale.

Incidentally, I didn't notice this before, but the location here is similar (though it doesn't look to be the exact same) to the one which Reina and Kumiko climbed to on the night of the festival during the TV anime.
